1
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,998
- Okay. I'll go first. Um...
- Okay.

2
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,751
Let me say, uh, we don't
really need to be here.

3
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,754
See, we've been married
five years.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,673
- Six.
- Five, six years.

5
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,218
And this is like
a checkup for us.

6
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,430
Um, a chance
to poke around the engine...

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,726
maybe change the oil,
replace a seal or two.

8
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,811
Yeah.

9
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,648
Very well then. Let's pop the hood.

10
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,070
On a scale of one to 10,
how happy are you as a couple?

11
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,489
- Eight.
- Wait.

12
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,909
Ten being perfectly happy
and one being totally miserable?

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,162
- Or...
- Just respond instinctively.

14
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,872
Okay.

15
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,457
- Ready?
- Ready.

16
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,042
- Eight.
- Eight.

17
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,881
How often do you have sex?

18
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,884
I don't understand
the question.

19
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,970
Yeah, I'm lost.
Is this a one-to-10 thing?

20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,057
Like, is one very little,
or is one nothing?

21
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,851
Because, you know,
tech-technically speaking...

22
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,813
the zero
would be nothing.

23
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,899
That's right. And if we don't know
what one is... What's 10?

24
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:53,028
- Yeah, 'cause 10... Oh, God.

25
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,657
- Constant. Uh...
- Unrelenting.

26
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,952
- N-Not stopping for, like... I mean, just...
- Nothing to eat.

27
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,082
Like Sting.

28
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,211
Well, look at Sting's day job. Who else
has 60 hours a week to put in the sack?

29
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:13,507
It's not a one-to-10 scenario. It's a
basic question. How often do you have sex?

30
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,517
How about this week?

31
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,523
- Including the weekend?
- Sure.

32
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,449
Describe
how you first met.

33
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,868
Uh, it was...
It was in Colombia.

34
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,870
Bogotá.

35
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,623
- Five years ago.
- Six.

36
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,709
Right.
Five or six years ago.

37
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,355
Hey. ¿Qué pasa?

38
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,703
Hmm?

39
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,969
No.

40
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,724
No, no, no, no.
Está bien.

41
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,519
She's with me.
Está bien.

42
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,697
I'm Jane.

43
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,491
John.

44
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,702
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet ya.

45
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,167
- To dodging bullets.
- To dodging bullets.

46
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,426
So, it speaks.

47
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,845
But does it dance?

48
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,902
Hiya, stranger.

49
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,904
Hiya back.

50
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,161
I think room service fled.
I did what I could.

51
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,539
Thank you.

52
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,377
Mm! Oh, that's good.

53
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:04,548
I hope so. I had to milk a goat to get it.

54
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,462
Hey! Step right up!

55
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,464
Ladies and gentlemen,
try your lu...

56
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,758
How about you, little lady?
Wanna try your luck?

57
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,760
Win a prize.

58
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,762
Hmm. Yeah.
All right.

59
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,226
- Two.
- We got two over here.

60
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,356
- Do you know how to hold it?
- Step right up! Five shots. Five dollars.

61
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,109
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

62
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,363
- You gotta aim.
- I am.

63
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,449
Don't laugh.
I'll kill you.

64
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:16,286
You didn't blink.

65
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,790
Would you like to win
a stuffed animal for your little girl?

66
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,500
- Come on.
- Ooh.

67
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,919
Everybody's a winner.

68
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,921
Do we still
get somethin'?

69
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,840
Beginner's luck.

70
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,845
- I wanna go again.
- We're goin' again.

71
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,356
Everybody's a winner.
Win a prize. Win a prize.

72
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,526
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

73
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,528
Beginner's luck.

74
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,200
Stop. Stop. You've only known
the girl for six weeks.

75
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,037
I'm in love.
She's smart, sexy.

76
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,874
She's uninhibited,
spontaneous, complicated.

77
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,460
She's the sweetest thing
I've ever seen!

78
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,546
I knew Gladys for two and a half years
before I asked her to marry me.

79
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,883
You have to have a foundation of friendship,
brother. The other stuff fades.

80
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,803
Hi.

81
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,813
So, you don't think
this is all happening a little fast?

82
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,775
You know me. I never do anything
without thinking it through.

83
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,777
What does he do?

84
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,322
He's in construction.
He's a big-time contractor.

85
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,491
A server goes down
on Wall Street...

86
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,785
she's there anytime,
day or night.

87
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,083
She's like Batman
for computers.

88
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,170
He's gone as much as I am,
so... it's perfect.

89
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,007
I give the whole thing
six months tops.

90
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,260
Eddie, I asked her
to marry me.

91
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,514
What?

92
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,766
- I'm getting married.
- What? I can't hear ya.

93
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,311
- I'm getting married.
- I can't hear him.

94
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,438
Can you stop hittin' him?
I think he said somethin' crazy.

95
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,858
I'm getting married!

96
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,567
- Gotta get these filters changed.
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,028
What did you think
of Dr. Wexler?

98
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,614
- His questions were a bit wishy-washy.
- Yeah. Sorry.

99
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,659
- Not the most insightful.
- No.

100
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,995
His office
is clear across town.

101
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,498
You know that 4: 00 means we hit rush hour.
I'm not crazy about that.

102
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,086
- So, that's settled then, yeah?
- Okay.

103
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:16,550
Okay.

104
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:36,111
- Dinner's at 7: 00.
- Yep. I'll be there... here.

105
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,918
- Hi, babe.
- Perfect timing.

106
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,588
It's pissin' rain out there.

107
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,428
Here's your butter.
I bring you butter.

108
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,725
- How was work?
- Eh, so-so.

109
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,061
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

110
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,646
Oh, I stopped off
for a drink with Eddie.

111
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,444
- This is salted.
- What?

112
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,529
It's salted.

113
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,949
Is there any other kind?

114
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,285
Unsalted.

115
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,662
Like I asked for.

116
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,124
It's fine. I'll make it work.

117
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,252
- Okay.
- Oh, I got new curtains.

118
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,299
Well?
What do you think?

119
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,803
- Huh.
- There was a struggle over the material.

120
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,846
This little tea sandwich
of a man...

121
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:12,142
- He got his hands on them first, but I won.
- Of course you did.

122
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,937
They're a bit green. I think we're
gonna have to reupholster the sofas...

123
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,897
and definitely get a new rug,
maybe a Persian.

124
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,733
Or we can keep the old ones.
Then we don't have to change a thing.

125
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,904
We talked about this.
You remember?

126
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,370
I remember. I remember
'cause we said we'd wait.

127
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:35,332
If you don't like 'em,
we can take 'em back.

128
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,460
Okay. I don't like 'em.

129
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,630
You'll get used to 'em.

130
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,554
- I like 'em.
- Yeah.

131
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,923
Huh. Zero percent A. P. R.
Till March.

132
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,179
So, part two. Here we are.

133
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,432
Only this time, you came back alone.
Why did you come back?

134
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,434
I'm not sure really.

135
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,146
Let me clarify.
I love my wife.

136
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,732
Um, I want her
to be happy.

137
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,735
Uh, I want
good things for her.

138
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,572
But there are times...

139
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,344
- Honey, would you just...
- Five more minutes.

140
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,429
So what's the problem?

141
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,849
There's this huge space
between us...

142
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:20,354
and it just keeps filling up with everything
that we don't say to each other.

143
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,149
- What is that called?
- Marriage.

144
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,861
What don't you say
to each other?

145
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,034
Uh... Hmm.

146
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,496
The GMC Yukon
got three stars.

147
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,458
This looks nice.
Did you do something new?

148
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,336
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

149
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,338
I added peas.

150
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,424
Yeah, peas.

151
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,386
Yeah, it's the green.

152
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,349
Sweetheart,
will you pass the salt?

153
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,144
It's in the middle
of the table.

154
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,396
Oh, is that the middle
of the table?

155
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,232
Yeah. It's between
you and me.

156
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,319
Okay.

157
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,449
- How honest are you with him?
- Pretty honest.

158
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,994
I mean, it's not like
I lie to him... or anything.

159
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,456
We just, uh,
Have little secrets.

160
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,833
Everybody has secrets, you know.

161
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,861
Shit. Sorry, hon.

162
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,863
- I'll get it.
- No, I got it. I got it. Don't move.

163
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,200
Oh, that's me.

164
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,477
Jesus!

165
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,313
- Honey, you scared me.
- I'm sorry, hon.

166
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,233
I was lookin' for the, uh...
You goin' out?

167
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,237
Yeah. Some clown crashed a server
in a law firm downtown...

168
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,906
and ended the world
as they know it, so, yes.

169
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,908
Mmm.

170
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,579
We promised the Colemans.

171
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,581
- I know.
- Okay.

172
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,916
I'll be there.
In and out.

173
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,960
Just a quickie.

174
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,756
It probably feels like
you're the only people going through this.

175
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:37,301
But I'll tell you something.
There are millions of couples...

176
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,386
that are experiencing
the same problems.

177
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,182
Uh-huh.

178
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,600
- We got a plane in an hour.
- All right.

179
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,602
Quotes. 800.

180
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,688
Prodded about possible insider trading...

181
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,940
she remarked
on national television...

182
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,067
"I want to focus
on my salad."

183
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,069
- Brian.
- Martha Stewart.

184
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,020
Forty.

185
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,647
I'll match your...
What the hell? What's this shite?

186
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,526
Sorry. Where's the can
around here?

187
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,071
- For Chrissakes.
- Take a...

188
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,742
- Hey, you guys playin' poker?
- Private game. Piss off.

189
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,785
Hey, could I sit in?
You think I can sit in?

190
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,871
What part of "piss off"
do you not understand?

191
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:32,041
Guys. Hey, whoa, whoa.
Be a little friendly.

192
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,126
I got the cash. I got the ca...

193
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:37,796
Dude, I'm just showing you
my bankroll, man.

194
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,382
I got the money.

195
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,635
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?

196
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,138
Poker...
Don't even know her.

197
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,223
So if you want me
to sit in, I'll sit in.

198
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,726
And I'll play some cards with youse.
If you don't, I won't.

199
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,770
I just...
Fine with me, I'll go.

200
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,485
- Jesus.
- Here's an empty chair.
I could sit right here.

201
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,904
That is Lucky's chair.

202
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,406
Wh-Where's Lucky?
I don't see Lucky.

203
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,701
- Lucky's not back yet.
- Then I'll sit here.

204
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,997
Unless...
I'm too hot for ya.

205
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,665
- Solid silver.
- Ooh. Raise the socks.

206
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,460
- Ooh.
- "To dodging bullets. Love, Jane."

207
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,754
In the pot. Put it in the pot.

208
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,799
- Ohh! Ohh!
- Oh, he's pulled something.

209
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,176
- He's pulled something.
- You're in trouble now.

210
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:10,264
- Sixty dollars, eh?
- In!

211
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,688
Let's play some poker!

212
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:20,190
Drat!

213
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,526
You've got 14
different tells.

214
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,653
You are bleeding William Tell.

215
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:31,285
What the hell is this?

216
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,038
- Sorry, Lucky.
- Looks like you're done, pal.

217
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,040
- Thanks for the memories.
- Oh, you Lucky?

218
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,875
- Yeah.
- No kiddin'.

219
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,586
What is it, kid?
You lookin' for a job or somethin'?

220
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,671
- You are the job.

221
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,189
Pair of threes.

222
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,780
- Have you been a bad boy?
- Yes.

223
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,449
Mm-hmm?

224
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,828
You know what happens
to bad boys?

225
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,375
- They get punished.
- Oh, yeah. Punish me.

226
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,300
Have you been selling
big guns to bad people?

227
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,094
Huh?

228
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,435
Mr. Racin.

229
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,772
Mr. Racin. You okay?

230
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,025
Oh, Colemans.

231
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,366
He's down!

232
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,331
On the sofa!

233
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,760
- Hey!
- Taxi.

234
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,809
- Everything okay at work?
- Yeah. Here.

235
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,979
- Yeah?
- And you? How was the game?

236
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,273
- The game was good.
- Good.

237
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,358
Nets in overtime.

238
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,738
- You been drinking?
- That's right, miss.

239
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:33,407
Welcome, neighbors!

240
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,493
- Hey. Hi, Susan.
- Good to see you, John.

241
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,495
- Hi.
- There you go.

242
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,706
- Oh, this is wonderful.
- Thank you.

243
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,833
Oh, I love that.

244
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,462
- What a lovely dress.
- Thank you very much. So is yours.

245
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,465
Come on. Let's go
see the girls.

246
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,467
Don't stray too far,
guys.

247
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,469
You want a Cuban?

248
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:56,096
- Oh, no, no, no. I don't smoke.
- Oh.

249
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,141
- Clean body, clean soul.
That's what Suzy says.
- Ain't that the truth?

250
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,560
- You guys have any vices?
- Well, you know.

251
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:05,356
- Can I get you a drink?
- Uh, yes. Chardonnay, please.

252
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,650
- Girls?
- Chardonnay.

253
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,862
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
- I'll be up here at the filling station.

254
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,531
Duxbury's never gonna close that high.
I hear their stock's getting butchered.

255
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,533
- Hey, boys. Scotch.
- Hey, John.

256
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,577
- Yes, sir.
- It's a bloodbath over there.

257
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:21,038
Johnno. How'd you make out last quarter?
You take a beating?

258
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:25,250
Actually, I got all my dough
buried under the toolshed.

259
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:28,212
- So, Chuck got the promotion.
- My God! That is so great!

260
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,214
Fantastic!

261
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,050
I'm so excited. We can finally
put the addition on the kitchen.

262
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:35,886
Oh, shoot. Not again.

263
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,472
I should wear a raincoat.

264
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:42,059
You know what? Would...
Can you hold her for a second?

265
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,728
- What? No. I'd rather not.
- It's all over the appliqué.

266
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:48,232
- Oh, no, I'm...
- Please, just...

267
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,820
Oh. Seltzer.

268
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,992
Oh, she likes you.

269
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,049
I liked your dress tonight.

270
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,594
It was nice.

271
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,638
Thank you.

272
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,402
- Be there in the morning. Okay.
- Of course.

273
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,577
- Everything all right?
- Uh, yeah. It was... It was Dad.

274
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,787
He's a...
He thinks he has pneumonia.

275
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:47,082
I'm sure it's just a cold,
and you know how he is. He'll be fine.

276
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,752
Yeah. Probably.

277
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,338
Maybe you should go see him.
I think he'd like that.

278
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:57,092
Hmm. Yeah.
Yeah, maybe I will.

279
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,186
Good night then.

280
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,107
- Who was that?
- Huh?

281
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:15,402
- Who was on the phone?
- Oh, the Atlanta office.

282
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,447
There's a problem with the specs
for the dam again.

283
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:22,368
I'll fly in the morning.
I'll be gone a couple of days.

284
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,705
- That damn dam, huh?
- Yup, that damn dam.

285
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,835
- All right, good night, John.
- Good night.

286
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,460
Okay.

287
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:59,173
- There's trouble in Atlanta again.
- That's what I hear.

288
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,926
- What you got?
- I've got your boarding pass
and taxi receipts.

289
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:06,388
- Get rid of that gun-gum.
- You got a tissue?

290
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:09,641
- And your hotel bill. Now don't lose those.
- Thanks.

291
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,769
The door's unlocked.

292
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,145
Mornin', pal.

293
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:17,399
- How you doin'?
- Same old same old. People need killin'.

294
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:22,154
Oh, Johnny. I might have a little
get-together this weekend... at my house.

295
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,949
Barbecue. No ladies. Dudes only.
It's gonna be awesome.

296
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:30,079
- Yeah. I'll talk to the missus.
- You wanna use my cell phone?

297
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,873
Maybe you wanna give her a call in case
you wanna decide to scratch your ass...

298
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,876
or use the head later,
make sure she thinks it's okay.

299
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,504
You live with your mother.

300
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,548
Why would you bring her into this?
She happens to be a first-class lady.

301
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,842
I don't have to check in with her
every time I wanna do somethin'.

302
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,429
She cooks, cleans,
makes me snacks.

303
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,473
I'm the dumb guy?

304
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,158
John Smith.

305
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:15,207
Hello, John.
- Good morning, Atlanta.

306
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,251
Quite the body count this week.

307
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:20,546
We have a priority one,
so I need your expertise.

308
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:25,426
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
A.K.A. "the Tank."

309
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,095
He's a direct threat to the firm.

310
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,139
D.I.A. Custody.

311
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:33,225
They're making a ground-to-air
handoff to heli...

312
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,644
10 miles north
of the Mexican border.

313
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:39,523
I need you to make sure
the target does not change hands.

314
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:40,858
The Tank?

315
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:07,009
- I-Temp Technology Staffing.
- Jane Smith confirmed.

316
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,011
Stand by for contact.

317
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,764
Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation.

318
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,641
You know the competition
would love to see us burn...

319
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,810
so I need you to handle this personally.

320
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:19,021
- Target?
- Benjamin Danz.

321
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,023
I'm rolling the specs now.

322
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:24,818
- We need this quick, clean and contained.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:36,955
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.
- Hello, Jane.

324
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:41,627
Yesterday's op resulted in one kill
and one agent in protective custody.

325
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,629
Not good.
We'll get him out tomorrow.

326
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:46,340
Another two cases of the G40's.
The grenade launchers are here.

327
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:48,759
Order 10 more.
All right. Go, Jas.

328
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:52,513
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
A.K.A. "the Tank."

329
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,515
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

330
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,601
The target's being moved across
the border to a federal facility.

331
00:32:57,686 --> 00:33:01,605
The only point of vulnerability
is just south of the border.

332
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,066
I want G. P.S. And S.A.C.
Of the canyon...

333
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,068
and the weather report
for the last three days.

334
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,656
Target will rendezvous with the helicopter
here at a deserted airstrip.

335
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,409
We will have
one chance to strike.

336
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:58,787
Are we green?
- Perimeter is armed. We are up and running.

337
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,470
Red team! Red team!
This is Broadway Joe.

338
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,765
- Halftime is approaching.
- Copy that, Broadway Joe.

339
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,888
Oh, come on.

340
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:07,731
- You getting this?
- Affirmative. Is it a threat?

341
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:14,947
Countdown's initiated.
Convoy is not in the zone yet.

342
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:17,533
There's an idiot in the field.
He's gonna blow the charges.

343
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,137
Ah.

344
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,100
Okay.

345
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,985
You gotta be kidding.

346
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,240
Civilians.

347
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:13,464
Let's see if we can't get
a tune out of this trombone.

348
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:19,845
We're picking up
a weapon signature.

349
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:22,139
Shit! Not a civilian.

350
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,770
Oh, man.

351
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,606
Asshole.

352
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,200
Convoy is in the zone!
Countdown is initiated.

353
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,973
Whoa!

354
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:07,393
You should so not be allowed
to buy these things.

355
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,403
Abort! Abort!

356
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,238
I think I got I.D.’d on that hit.

357
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,741
- You ever been I.D.’d on a hit?
- Not that I'm aware of, no.

358
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,035
- Right. I think I'm in trouble.
- You get a look at 'im?

359
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,747
Little thing.
Buck 10, buck 15 tops.

360
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,791
- Maybe he's Filipino.
- Maybe.

361
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,877
I'm not even sure
it was a him.

362
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:19,298
Are you sayin' that you got
your ass kicked by some girl?

363
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,050
- That's right.
- Really?

364
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:23,052
- A pro.
- This should be easy.

365
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:25,137
I mean, how many hitters
do you know that are chicks? Right?

366
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:26,680
I'm sorry, man.

367
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,391
- You guys want any dessert?
- What do you have, honey?

368
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,226
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream?

369
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,771
- That sounds delicious.
What flavors do you have?
- Chocolate and vanilla.

370
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,773
I don't like either of those...
separately.

371
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:38,734
But maybe mixed together,
that could be... a nice little dish.

372
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,778
You know what I mean?
And not just a little pink spoon.

373
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:43,238
I'd like the whole sundae.

374
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,282
- That could be arranged.
- Perfect.

375
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,868
Could be arranged. Did you hear that?
I'd like to have her kick my ass.

376
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:50,204
- You know what I mean?
- Right.

377
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,289
Did you get any other details
on her besides her weight class?

378
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,708
- Laptop.
- I'm sorry? You're in
a whole zone right now.

379
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,543
I'm havin' a hard time
talkin' to you.

380
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,170
- Laptop.
- Okay, laptop.

381
00:38:58,296 --> 00:39:00,589
I wanna know
who that bitch is!

382
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:04,218
- Get me that tape. Get me that tape.
- Jane.

383
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,553
- What?
- It's Father.

384
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:16,855
The F.B.I. secured the package.
The window's closed, sir.

385
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:19,066
I told you we couldn't
afford any mistakes on this one.

386
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,695
- There was another player.
- We do not leave witnesses.

387
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:27,282
If this player I.D.’d you...
You know the rules.

388
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:30,369
You have 48 hours
to clean the scene, Jane.

389
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:32,329
Lookin' forward to it, sir.

390
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,544
All right. We have a new target.
Let's find out who he is.

391
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:45,175
Jesus.
What did you do to it?

392
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,302
Put a campfire out with it?

393
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:50,639
Buy a new one.

394
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:53,183
This one has sentimental value
for its owner.

395
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,269
Who's that?

396
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:58,564
Well, Gwen,
I'm just hoping you'd tell me.

397
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:04,737
So, uh, why you gotta
know so bad anyway?

398
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,281
You know me.
Just tryin' to return some lost property.

399
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:10,492
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, John.

400
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:14,079
- Are you a vegan?
- No.

401
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:16,165
My girlfriend is.

402
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,377
Here we go.

403
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:23,422
Upgraded RAM module.

404
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:26,633
Line three. Pick up.

405
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,929
Chip's Chinese.
Imported by Dynamix.

406
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:34,183
Retailed by, uh...

407
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,103
You know, I might be able
to get you a billing address.

408
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:40,939
All right.

409
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,108
No name.
Just an address.

410
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:47,738
570 Lexington Avenue.
Suite 5003.

411
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,740
New York.

412
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:51,742
You know the place?

413
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:30,072
Sweet Jesus.
Mother of God.

414
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,884
Why don't you both
go make some coffee?

415
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,117
Jane, it's your husband.

416
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:19,329
He's back from Atlanta.
He wants to know about dinner.

417
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:24,501
Tell him...
dinner's at 7: 00.

418
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:28,130
Hi, John. Yeah,
she says dinner's at 7: 00.

419
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:31,133
It always is.

420
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:42,830
Perfect timing.

421
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:44,915
As always.

422
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,798
- This is a nice surprise.
- I hope so.

423
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:55,759
- You're home early.
- I missed you.

424
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:59,471
Mm. I missed you too.

425
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:01,932
- Shall we?
- Yes.

426
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:18,282
Thought you only broke these out
for special occasions.

427
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,284
This is a special occasion.

428
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,124
Mm.

429
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:37,651
Mm!

430
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:54,568
Mm! Pot roast.
My favorite.

431
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:02,242
Allow me, sweetheart.

432
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,328
You've been
on your feet all day.

433
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:07,748
- Thank you.
- Sure.

434
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:12,044
Mm.

435
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:25,683
So, how's work?

436
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:32,481
Actually, we had a...
a little trouble with a commission.

437
00:45:32,607 --> 00:45:34,566
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

438
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:39,029
- Double booking with another firm.
- Huh.

439
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:42,074
- Green beans?
- No, thank you.

440
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,201
You'll have some.

441
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:49,957
I hope everything
works out okay.

442
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:54,420
It hasn't yet,
but it will.

443
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:05,514
Pot roast is my favorite.

444
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:07,850
Sweetheart,
could you pass the salt?

445
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:47,598
- Did you try something new?
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:52,144
Mm!

447
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:07,743
So, how was Atlanta?

448
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:10,412
Had a few problems ourselves.
Some figures didn't add up.

449
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:14,792
- Big deal?
- Life or death.

450
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:17,169
- Wine?
- Yeah.

451
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:41,819
- I got it.
- I got it. I'll get a towel.

452
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:56,041
Janey?

453
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:02,089
Honey?

454
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,780
Jane!

455
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:25,029
How could I be so stupid?

456
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,709
Jane! Jane!

457
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,839
God.

458
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,398
Oh, dear God.

459
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:08,614
Oh.

460
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,700
Wait. No, no, no, no.
Accident.

461
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:13,327
Honey? Accident.

462
00:49:13,411 --> 00:49:15,287
Jane, stop the car! Now!

463
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:19,333
Jane!

464
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,418
You've overreacting!

465
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,755
Honey, let's not
get carried away.

466
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:28,342
We don't wanna go to sleep angry. God!

467
00:49:28,426 --> 00:49:30,761
Pull over.

468
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:32,680
Pull over! Pull over!

469
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:37,518
Now, look...

470
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,941
We need to talk!

471
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:56,954
Okay, I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

472
00:49:57,038 --> 00:49:58,997
- Who is it?
- Open up.

473
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:04,378
- What the hell happened to you?
- My wife.

474
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,846
- She tried to kill me.
- Yes, she did. And you know what?

475
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:16,015
Gladys tried to kill me,
not with a car.

476
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:18,350
At least Jane was a man about it.
She was up front about it.

477
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:21,770
They all try to kill you...
slowly, painfully, cripplingly.

478
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:23,814
And then-wham.
They hurt you.

479
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:26,734
You know how hurt I used to be over her,
and I used to beat myself up?

480
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,819
Now I'm great.
I got dates all the time.

481
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:30,821
I just woke up from a thing.
I'm in my robe.

482
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:32,823
- You live with your mom.
- I live with my mom because I choose to.

483
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:34,825
Because that's the only
woman I've ever trusted.

484
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,869
Most of them
are passive-aggressive.

485
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:39,872
There's a whole psychology.
I've been reading books,
given what I've gone through.

486
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:41,623
And, uh, it's disgusting.

487
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:45,085
Do you know there is nothing more cruel
on this Earth than a 13-year-old girl.

488
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,379
They literally form cliques
in high school.

489
00:50:47,505 --> 00:50:50,341
And they play cruel games on each other.
A-And test boundaries with each other.

490
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:52,426
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just saying about
you have to understand...

491
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,511
I'm hurting over here.
And you're talking about 13-year-old girls.

492
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:56,513
Because I'm trying
to get you past the hurt.

493
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:59,016
You have to understand the enemy...
what you're up against.

494
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:01,310
I know exactly
what you're thinkin'.

495
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:04,688
If she lied about that, what else
is it possible that she lied about?

496
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:07,983
Her job is a spy
to get information from people.

497
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,819
French Riviera, a yacht?

498
00:51:10,945 --> 00:51:12,863
An Iranian prince?

499
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:16,075
She's supposed to get close to him
and gain his trust. It's disgusting.

500
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:19,661
What?
What are you saying?

501
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:23,707
What?
Your husband is the shooter?

502
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:25,709
That's impossible.

503
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,587
Really?

504
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:31,298
This whole thing was probably
planned from the beginning.

505
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:35,469
Operation Stake Out Johnny. A six-year
stakeout to get information from you.

506
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:37,554
Mission accomplished.

507
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:42,601
Okay.

508
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:44,895
Here's the upside.

509
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:47,022
- You don't love him.
- No.

510
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:50,693
You'll kill him, and nobody's
better at that than you are.

511
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:53,362
Thank you.

512
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,447
And then it'll be over.

513
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:01,036
Mm.

514
00:52:03,331 --> 00:52:07,376
- What if she's listening?
- What?

515
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,379
Do you think it's possible
that she rigged the house?

516
00:52:10,463 --> 00:52:12,423
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, dude.

517
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:16,135
It could be very possible because of
th-the pattern of how she's handled stuff.

518
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:18,762
It wouldn't surprise me.
That's probably why she doesn't like me.

519
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:21,306
- Because she heard me call her a troll.
- You're out of your mind.

520
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,809
I'm just saying it's possible. The woman
just tried to run you over with a car...

521
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,853
That she could hear you.

522
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,439
And I don't give a shit.
I hope she is listening.

523
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:31,525
I hope you are listening, Jane.
You know what, I'm on to you.

524
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:34,611
You might have fooled my boy, 'cause he
was blinded. It's okay. She knows this.

525
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:37,322
But I'm not me.
I hope you're listening to me.

526
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:40,367
And I hope you know th-that I slept
with your friend, Jasmine. Huh?

527
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:41,952
- Shh.
- We're on the board.

528
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:44,496
I'm just saying we're on the board my man.
Come on. We're on the board.

529
00:52:44,622 --> 00:52:47,082
You thought it was 37-0.
We got five points on the board.

530
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:50,878
I nailed Jasmine and she was
bad in bed, baby. Johnny, I'm not...

531
00:52:50,962 --> 00:52:54,131
I know you're embarrassed, but, come on,
it's me. It's Eddie you're talkin' to.

532
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:56,633
The guys we work with, they don't know.
I'm never gonna tell them.

533
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,346
The people she works with probably got
a big laugh over this over the last six years.

534
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:02,473
But so what? Who cares?
That's not important.

535
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:06,060
Lookit, it's like 150 pages of a book
have been written.

536
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,562
In the first 150 pages,
Johnny's been a clown.

537
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:11,190
You can write
the last 10 pages.

538
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:14,443
You've been smoked,
but you can write the last 10 pages.

539
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:19,281
Great talk, man. We should
do it more often. It was a great talk.

540
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,950
- I'm proud of you.
- I'm gonna borrow this.

541
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:25,996
- I like where your head's at.
- I'll do it in the morning.

542
00:53:27,665 --> 00:53:29,541
- You okay?
- Yep. Okay.

543
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:31,627
- Good night.
- Good night.

544
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,061
You don't love him.

545
00:53:49,187 --> 00:53:52,272
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Eddie.

546
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:54,316
Good night, Mom.

547
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,158
Okay, girls, let's go.

548
00:54:44,242 --> 00:54:47,911
Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks.
You know the drill.

549
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:09,183
This is nice. Who picked this out?

550
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:15,814
- What is this?
- It looks like your wedding.

551
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,900
- I know what it is. What are you doing?
- Research.

552
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:20,569
- Background on the target.
- This room is wrapped.

553
00:55:20,695 --> 00:55:22,654
Thank you.

554
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,657
...to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish.

555
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:30,204
- Till death do us part.
- I promise.

556
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:36,126
I, John, take you, Jane,
for my lawfully wedded wife...

557
00:55:36,252 --> 00:55:38,253
to have and to hold...

558
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,839
It's all coming out of the house.

559
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:43,092
Well done, ladies.
Let's wrap it up.

560
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:49,431
- What's going on, Mrs. Smith?
- Garden party, girls.

561
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:01,068
- Hi, neighbor.
- John, hey.

562
00:56:01,152 --> 00:56:04,405
- Hey.
- Ooh, pumpkin. It's a big one.

563
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:15,332
Wow. I can't believe I've never been
in here before. This is great.

564
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:17,376
- Let's start with the living room.
- Oh, yeah.

565
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:21,296
- Oh. Nice floors. They teak or something?
- Yeah.

566
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,133
Fuck if I know, Martin.

567
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:29,346
Uh, and you won
the Golf Masters' trophy this year.

568
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:31,098
Again.

569
00:56:31,182 --> 00:56:33,475
Again. It'll be sittin'
on your mantel next year.

570
00:57:04,382 --> 00:57:06,258
Bitch.

571
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:13,932
Target profile is our main priority.

572
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:16,894
Utilize all means necessary.

573
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:20,522
Phone taps, credit cards.
Audio scan civilian frequencies.

574
00:57:20,648 --> 00:57:22,483
Uh, with what, Jane?

575
00:57:25,653 --> 00:57:27,571
You've reached the Smiths.

576
00:57:27,697 --> 00:57:30,699
We can't take your call right now,
but leave a message after the tone...

577
00:57:30,825 --> 00:57:32,743
and we'll get back to you.

578
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:35,621
- And search the database.
- For what? John Smith?

579
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:42,878
- Find him.
- Uh, Jane.

580
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:45,089
What?

581
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:47,299
- I think I found him.
- Where?

582
00:57:47,425 --> 00:57:49,802
Here.

583
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:54,515
Heat sensor breach
in the perimeter.

584
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:57,976
Commence scanning all floors.

585
00:58:00,438 --> 00:58:03,524
I thought I told you
not to bother me at the office, honey.

586
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:07,194
- Well, you are still Mrs. Smith.
- Well, so are a lot of girls.

587
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:12,199
Careful, Jane. I can push the button
anytime, anywhere, sweetheart.

588
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:15,744
Baby, you couldn't find the button
with both hands and a map.

589
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:21,959
- Last warning. You need to disappear.
- No.

590
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,836
- Now.
- "D" Sector clear.

591
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:25,879
You really expect me
to roll over and play dead?

592
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:28,215
You should be used to it
after five years of marriage.

593
00:58:28,299 --> 00:58:30,801
Six. And I'm not leaving.

594
00:58:30,885 --> 00:58:32,803
"E" Sector clear.

595
00:58:32,887 --> 00:58:34,138
Uh-huh.

596
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:36,890
Anywhere, anytime.

597
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:38,684
Intruder detected.

598
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,020
Evacuate. Plan "C."

599
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:53,172
Evacuation in progress.

600
00:59:09,507 --> 00:59:11,467
I've already done this side.

601
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:12,885
Let's go!

602
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:13,737
Chickenshit!

603
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:15,739
Pussy!

604
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:23,706
You're tellin' me you had a shot at her
and you didn't take it?

605
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,000
What I'm trying to say is
we got all this stuff here...

606
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:28,168
and you're trying to tell me
you couldn't take her out?

607
01:00:28,294 --> 01:00:30,796
Well, now she's a problem
for both of us.

608
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,049
Now my house is priority one.

609
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:36,802
Just give me a hand,
will ya?

610
01:00:36,928 --> 01:00:40,305
Please. You're driving me crazy
with the tongs in the furnace.
You're like an insane man.

611
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:43,559
All right.
They gave you 48 hours.

612
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:46,520
What do we got left here?
Twenty-three? Twenty-two?

613
01:00:46,604 --> 01:00:48,522
Eighteen and change.

614
01:00:48,606 --> 01:00:51,608
- You got 18 hours until they
close the book on both of you?
- Eddie.

615
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:54,653
Mom! We're on high alert here!

616
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:56,655
I almost killed you right then!

617
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,866
You do not even realize!

618
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:00,868
Never mind.

619
01:01:00,952 --> 01:01:03,328
I am so done playing games
with this broad.

620
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:05,330
You gotta take this bitch
out head-on.

621
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:07,374
Don't tell me
how to handle my wife.

622
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:10,836
This broad is not your wife.
She's the enemy. And she could
be outside right now!

623
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,130
Eddie.

624
01:01:13,256 --> 01:01:15,758
Got it.

625
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:19,678
Now we're talkin'. Only question is
how much is it to buy a vowel?

626
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:29,063
- Blackbow Realty.
- Yes. Hi. I'm calling from I-Temp.

627
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:31,482
Oh, great.
How's that new penthouse working out?

628
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:34,443
Well, just fine.
Thank you for asking.

629
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:05,974
This is security.
There seems to be a problem
with your elevator, sir.

630
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:08,852
Do you want an engineer to come up
and, uh, see what the problem is?

631
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:11,855
Take your time.
I'm really quite comfortable.

632
01:02:11,981 --> 01:02:14,358
Are you really comfortable?

633
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:16,443
Jane?

634
01:02:17,862 --> 01:02:20,197
Is that you, sweetheart?

635
01:02:20,323 --> 01:02:23,283
First and last warning, John.
Get out of town.

636
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:26,495
You know I'm not
goin' anywhere.

637
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:28,539
Oh, well, so you say.

638
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:32,876
But right now you're trapped in a steel box,
hanging 70 floors over nothin' but air.

639
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,670
Oh, so this is a trap.

640
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:36,505
He's in car three.

641
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:38,757
It's never gonna work, honey.

642
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:42,219
It's never gonna work because
you constantly underestimate me.

643
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:46,849
- Do I?
- You have no idea who I am.

644
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,560
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

645
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,938
Well, back at you, baby.

646
01:02:53,064 --> 01:02:56,775
Let me guess. Shaped charge
on the counterbalance cable.

647
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,570
Two more on the primary
and secondary brakes.

648
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:01,530
Maybe?

649
01:03:01,656 --> 01:03:04,366
- He found them.
- Yes. Thank you.

650
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:06,952
Did you also get the base charge
at the principal cable?

651
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,374
Promise to leave town,
or I'll blow it.

652
01:03:18,673 --> 01:03:22,092
Okay. I give up.

653
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:24,178
Blow it.

654
01:03:25,555 --> 01:03:28,974
- What?
- Go on. Blow it.

655
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,020
- You think I won't?
- I... I think you won't.

656
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:36,440
Okay.

657
01:03:36,524 --> 01:03:39,276
Five, four...

658
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:42,363
- Any last words?
- The new curtains are hideous.

659
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,239
Good-bye, John.

660
01:03:55,835 --> 01:03:58,379
- What the hell was that?
- What?

661
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,589
You said good-bye.

662
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:14,228
Shut off the gas!

663
01:05:49,532 --> 01:05:51,408
Madame.

664
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,204
Thought of a number of
lines for this moment.

665
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:58,248
"Thought I'd just drop in."

666
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:01,877
- "Hey, doll. Thanks for givin' me the shaft."
- Nice.

667
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:04,713
So, what did you decide?

668
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:07,716
I want a divorce.

669
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:09,760
I like it.

670
01:06:09,886 --> 01:06:12,596
You proposed to me here,
so it has agreeable symmetry.

671
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:14,556
Coat, sir?

672
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:18,018
- May I sit?
- No.

673
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,078
- Champagne, sir?
- No. Champagne's for celebrating.

674
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:38,122
I'll have a martini.

675
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:40,207
I'm fine. Thank you.

676
01:06:43,753 --> 01:06:45,629
I like the dress.

677
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:47,756
I'm in mourning.

678
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:49,800
You should wear it
more often.

679
01:06:51,594 --> 01:06:53,554
So, what do you want, John?

680
01:06:55,348 --> 01:06:57,266
We have an unusual
problem, Jane.

681
01:06:58,309 --> 01:07:00,269
You obviously want me dead.

682
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:03,647
- Hmm.
- And I'm less and less concerned
of your well-being.

683
01:07:03,773 --> 01:07:05,733
So, what do we do?

684
01:07:07,193 --> 01:07:09,903
Do we shoot it out here?
Hope for the best?

685
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,905
Mm. Well, that
would be a shame...

686
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,367
because they would probably ask me
to leave once you're dead.

687
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,789
Dance with me.

688
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:25,252
You don't dance.

689
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:27,421
Just part of my cover,
sweetheart.

690
01:07:27,505 --> 01:07:29,882
Was sloth part of it too?

691
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:35,220
Ow.

692
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,017
You think this story's
gonna have a happy ending?

693
01:07:40,101 --> 01:07:42,936
Happy endings are just stories
that haven't finished yet.

694
01:08:04,876 --> 01:08:07,378
Satisfied?

695
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:09,755
Not for years.

696
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:18,639
That's all John,
sweetheart.

697
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,201
Why is it
you think we failed?

698
01:08:39,327 --> 01:08:43,205
Because we were leading separate lives?
Or was it all the lying that did us in?

699
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:45,207
I have a theory.

700
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:48,210
- Newly formed.
- I'm breathless to hear it.

701
01:08:48,294 --> 01:08:50,629
- You killed us.
- Provocative.

702
01:08:52,757 --> 01:08:54,633
You approached
our marriage like a job...

703
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:57,094
something to be reconned,
planned and executed.

704
01:08:57,178 --> 01:08:59,722
And you avoided it.

705
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:02,391
What do you care,
if I was just a cover?

706
01:09:02,517 --> 01:09:04,518
Well, who said
you were just a cover?

707
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:08,731
- Wasn't I?
- Well, wasn't I?

708
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:17,614
I have to... Excuse me.

709
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,868
No exits
up there, Jane.

710
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:27,791
Be cold, John.
She's a liar.

711
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:33,881
Be super cold.

712
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:48,854
Come on, honey! This way!

713
01:10:06,164 --> 01:10:08,874
Do you know that you're ticking?

714
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,757
Get back!
Get back! Get back!

715
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:23,347
Limo, sir?

716
01:10:38,363 --> 01:10:40,364
Jane Smith.

717
01:10:40,448 --> 01:10:42,366
That's the second time
you tried to kill me.

718
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,618
Oh, come on.
It was just a little bomb.

719
01:10:44,703 --> 01:10:47,705
I want you to know. I'm goin'
home, and I'm gonna burn
everything I ever bought you.

720
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:50,416
I'll race you there, baby.

721
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:07,224
You there yet?

722
01:11:07,308 --> 01:11:11,270
The first time we met,
what was your first thought?

723
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:13,313
You tell me.

724
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:16,316
I thought...

725
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:21,488
I thought you looked like
Christmas morning.

726
01:11:23,658 --> 01:11:26,201
I don't know
how else to say it.

727
01:11:26,327 --> 01:11:28,829
And why are you
telling me this now?

728
01:11:28,913 --> 01:11:32,374
I guess, in the end,
you start thinkin' about the beginning.

729
01:11:36,254 --> 01:11:38,464
So there it is.
I thought you should know.

730
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:44,136
So how about it, Jane? Hmm?

731
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:47,598
I thought...

732
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:57,024
I thought that you were
the most beautiful mark I'd ever seen.

733
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,198
- So it was all business, yeah?
- All business.

734
01:12:04,282 --> 01:12:06,700
- From the go.
- Cold, hard math.

735
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:10,954
Thank you. That's what
I needed to know.

736
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,251
- Okay.
- Okay.

737
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,178
Hey, John.

738
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:10,472
Hey, Bill.

739
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:13,767
- Uh, are you all right?
- Yeah.

740
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:17,187
Okay.

741
01:13:17,272 --> 01:13:22,443
Uh, by the way, uh, John, your car
is hangin' out over the, uh, sidewalk here.

742
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:25,070
- Yeah. Thanks, Bill.
- Okay. Have a good night.

743
01:13:25,196 --> 01:13:27,156
Good night.

744
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,250
Shit.

745
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:08,525
You still alive, baby?

746
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:26,145
Your aim's as bad
as your cookin', sweetheart.

747
01:17:27,605 --> 01:17:29,565
Yeah.

748
01:17:29,649 --> 01:17:31,608
And that's saying something.

749
01:18:04,934 --> 01:18:07,436
Come on, honey.

750
01:18:08,813 --> 01:18:10,481
Come to daddy.

751
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:21,241
Who's your daddy now?

752
01:19:58,506 --> 01:20:01,091
I can't do it.

753
01:20:03,386 --> 01:20:06,388
Don't! Come on!

754
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:08,432
Come on!

755
01:20:10,685 --> 01:20:12,853
You want it?

756
01:20:12,937 --> 01:20:14,938
It's yours.

757
01:20:22,822 --> 01:20:24,782
Oh, I can't...

758
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:52,536
Come on. Mmm.

759
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,569
Hiya, stranger.

760
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:28,572
Hiya back.

761
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:40,876
- Yeah?
- Is everything okay?

762
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,753
We heard an awful ruckus.

763
01:22:42,879 --> 01:22:45,089
No. Everything's fine here.
Yeah. It's great.

764
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:47,800
So you guys are... You're fine?

765
01:22:47,926 --> 01:22:49,885
Yeah. Couldn't be better.

766
01:22:51,304 --> 01:22:54,390
Oh. Nice.
You guys... But are...

767
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:56,558
- Suzy. Martin. Officers.
- Have a nice night.

768
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:58,686
Looks like you're redecorating.
It's very...

769
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:01,188
Yeah. Shame about the teak.

770
01:23:57,287 --> 01:23:59,371
That left of yours.
A thing of beauty.

771
01:23:59,497 --> 01:24:01,623
- You take it well.
- Thank you.

772
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,338
- That vacation in Aspen...
- Mm.

773
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,716
You left early. Why?

774
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:15,095
- Jean-Luc Gaspard.
- Oh! God! Oh.

775
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,306
- Yeah.
- I wanted him.

776
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:20,893
- Forget it.
- Wow.

777
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:25,481
You didn't hear me that night
the chopper dropped me off
for our anniversary dinner?

778
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:28,108
- No.
- No?

779
01:24:28,234 --> 01:24:31,028
Mm. Percussion grenades.

780
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:33,113
I was partially deaf
that night.

781
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:40,662
- I'm slightly color blind.
- Mm.

782
01:24:40,747 --> 01:24:44,124
- Retinal scarring.
- I can't feel anything in these three fingers.

783
01:24:55,178 --> 01:24:57,304
- Three ribs. Broken eye socket.
- Mm. Oh.

784
01:24:57,430 --> 01:25:00,307
- Perforated eardrum. Mm.
- Mmm.

785
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:06,522
You ever have trouble
sleeping after?

786
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:11,568
- Nope.
- Yeah. Me neither.

787
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:49,606
Go, go, go, go, go!
Look out!

788
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:53,110
Move.

789
01:25:53,236 --> 01:25:55,446
Shoes.

790
01:25:59,951 --> 01:26:02,202
I was given 48 hours
to take you out.

791
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:05,289
- Same.
- Jesus. Where's the trust?

792
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:08,208
What do you expect?

793
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:15,632
Why do I get the girl gun?

794
01:26:19,429 --> 01:26:21,972
- Are you kiddin' me?
- No.

795
01:26:22,098 --> 01:26:24,058
Thank you.

796
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:04,765
Come on! They're outside!

797
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,736
Colemans.

798
01:28:06,244 --> 01:28:09,413
Guy's had my barbecue set for months.

799
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,666
I was never in the Peace Corps.

800
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:16,462
What? No.
I really liked that about you.

801
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:20,549
- Well, maybe this honesty thing
isn't such a good idea.
- No, no, no.

802
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:22,801
- I didn't go to M.I.T.
- Really?

803
01:28:22,927 --> 01:28:26,013
Notre Dame.
Art history major.

804
01:28:27,307 --> 01:28:30,059
- Art?
- History.

805
01:28:30,143 --> 01:28:32,603
- It's reputable.
- Okay.

806
01:28:53,124 --> 01:28:55,501
Fuckers get younger
every year.

807
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:05,886
I have to tell you.
I never really liked your cooking.

808
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:07,971
- It's not your gift.
- Hmm.

809
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:10,974
Baby, I've never cooked
a day in my life.

810
01:29:12,977 --> 01:29:14,937
I-Temp girls cooked.

811
01:29:15,021 --> 01:29:19,608
Web of lies!

812
01:29:32,288 --> 01:29:34,915
I like it. Deal with it.

813
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:40,879
- We got company.
- What?

814
01:29:42,674 --> 01:29:44,633
Shit.

815
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:57,771
- Baby, hold steady. Now!
- It's called evasive driving, sweetheart.

816
01:30:00,316 --> 01:30:03,193
Hold still!

817
01:30:10,785 --> 01:30:14,079
This thing's all over the place.
How do you drive these things anyways?

818
01:30:14,205 --> 01:30:16,373
Honey!

819
01:30:16,499 --> 01:30:18,250
Transmission's terrible.

820
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:24,673
- Honey, let me drive.
- I got it.

821
01:30:24,758 --> 01:30:27,718
Move over. Move.

822
01:30:27,802 --> 01:30:30,346
I'm the suburban housewife,
sweetheart.

823
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,514
- You move.
- Fine. Go.

824
01:30:34,809 --> 01:30:36,185
- Go.
- Go.

825
01:30:36,269 --> 01:30:38,228
- Go!
- Go!

826
01:30:46,863 --> 01:30:50,324
They're bulletproof.

827
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:02,336
You know, honey,
I should probably tell you.

828
01:31:03,713 --> 01:31:05,422
I was married once before.

829
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:16,266
- Are you out of your mind?
What is wrong with you?
- You're what's wrong with me.

830
01:31:16,393 --> 01:31:18,394
- It was a drunken Vegas thing!
- Oh, that's better!

831
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,270
- Stop it.
- That's much better. That's great.

832
01:31:20,397 --> 01:31:23,107
Stop it.

833
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:31,990
Go, go, go!

834
01:31:38,123 --> 01:31:41,750
What's her name
and Social Security number?

835
01:31:41,835 --> 01:31:43,919
No. You're not gonna kill her.

836
01:32:12,157 --> 01:32:14,408
These doors are handy.

837
01:32:20,832 --> 01:32:23,792
You know, sweetheart,
you're being a bit hypocritical.

838
01:32:23,918 --> 01:32:25,878
It's not like
you're some beacon of truth.

839
01:32:29,174 --> 01:32:31,175
John, my parents...

840
01:32:33,345 --> 01:32:36,096
They died when I was five.
I'm an orphan.

841
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:39,516
Who... Who was that kindly fella
who gave you away at our wedding?

842
01:32:39,642 --> 01:32:41,643
Paid actor.

843
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:46,899
- I said... I said I saw your dad
on Fantasy Island!
- I know.

844
01:32:48,276 --> 01:32:50,194
You know, I don't even
want to talk about it.

845
01:33:05,877 --> 01:33:07,961
- You got it?
- Got it.

846
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:10,923
- Any time.
- I got 'em.

847
01:33:53,425 --> 01:33:56,301
We're gonna have to redo
every conversation we've ever had.

848
01:33:57,971 --> 01:33:59,930
I'm Jewish.

849
01:34:02,726 --> 01:34:05,394
I can't believe I brought
my real parents to our wedding.

850
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,938
Disgusting. How could you
serve this to someone?

851
01:34:08,023 --> 01:34:10,482
Excuse me, ma'am.
Is it possible to get this reheated? Miss?

852
01:34:10,608 --> 01:34:12,818
Miss, I'm talkin' to you. Excuse me.

853
01:34:14,946 --> 01:34:17,448
- Jesus, Johnny.
- Good morning, Eddie.

854
01:34:17,574 --> 01:34:19,742
Morning.

855
01:34:19,868 --> 01:34:23,412
It's good to see
you're okay, man.

856
01:34:23,538 --> 01:34:26,040
Tell me you got smart
and that you killed that lyin' bitch.

857
01:34:26,124 --> 01:34:28,125
Hmm. This lying bitch?

858
01:34:29,544 --> 01:34:31,587
Guess it was just
wishful thinking.

859
01:34:31,713 --> 01:34:33,589
- I'm sorry.
- Eddie, we got...

860
01:34:33,715 --> 01:34:36,050
- It's nice to see you, Jane.
- Eddie. Eddie, focus, please.

861
01:34:36,134 --> 01:34:38,510
- We got problems.
- You got problems?

862
01:34:38,636 --> 01:34:41,430
Crack addicts got problems, my friend.
You two are smoked.

863
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:43,474
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

864
01:34:43,558 --> 01:34:45,684
John, you got the entire
agency gunnin' for ya.

865
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:48,437
- Probably have her agency
gunnin' for you too.
- What about you?

866
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:50,439
- Me?
- Where are you at?

867
01:34:50,523 --> 01:34:52,483
Where am I at?

868
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:56,195
I find myself dragging my feet
this morning.

869
01:34:56,279 --> 01:34:58,906
I think you owe me
a little money anyway.

870
01:35:02,327 --> 01:35:05,329
- What do you think?
- We don't understand each other.
And I understand that.

871
01:35:05,413 --> 01:35:08,290
But I don't need those looks from you.
I've been in his life a long time.

872
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:11,085
- Eddie, Eddie. Focus. Focus.
- I've been in his life for a long time.

873
01:35:11,169 --> 01:35:14,171
I'm pissed off. They blew up my house.
They shot at my wife. My own company.

874
01:35:16,174 --> 01:35:18,217
If she works for who the street...

875
01:35:18,343 --> 01:35:20,761
says that she works for...

876
01:35:20,845 --> 01:35:23,305
you're Macy's and Gimbel's.

877
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:25,849
She would be the WE channel,
and you would be...

878
01:35:25,934 --> 01:35:28,477
whatever channel it is
that competes against the WE channel.

879
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:30,604
- Know what I'm saying? You following me?
- Mm-hmm.

880
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:34,566
Johnny, the point is simple. Once you guys
decide to get off the reservation, that's it.

881
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:37,611
- Then you're off the reservation.
- Eddie, how bad?

882
01:35:37,696 --> 01:35:39,613
- How bad is it?
- Mm.

883
01:35:39,698 --> 01:35:41,615
You remember Canada.

884
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:44,493
- Ooh.
- That was kid stuff next to
what you're up against.

885
01:35:44,619 --> 01:35:46,537
- That was you?
- Oh, is that a turn-on?

886
01:35:46,621 --> 01:35:49,081
- She tried to kill you with a car.
Not my business.
- Stop.

887
01:35:49,207 --> 01:35:52,001
A good friend stays out of it.
I understand. This is the facts.

888
01:35:52,085 --> 01:35:54,420
If you two separate from
each other, you got a shot.

889
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:57,506
Not a great shot, Johnny,
but you got a shot.

890
01:35:57,590 --> 01:36:01,218
You two stay together,
you're dead.

891
01:36:01,344 --> 01:36:04,805
Unless you can find something
that they want more than they want you.

892
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:14,565
Found him. He's being held in subbasement
"D" of the federal courthouse.

893
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:17,109
High security.
Motion and thermal.

894
01:36:17,235 --> 01:36:19,820
Power's on a city grid.

895
01:36:19,904 --> 01:36:23,907
This is as far as we go, Jane.

896
01:36:24,034 --> 01:36:27,828
Right. Thanks for everything.
- Good luck, babe.

897
01:36:30,123 --> 01:36:32,541
We have this northwesterly flow...

898
01:36:32,625 --> 01:36:34,585
coming down through
the middle of the country.

899
01:36:34,669 --> 01:36:36,587
So we're seeing successive areas...

900
01:36:36,671 --> 01:36:38,714
Do one of you guys mind
changing the channel?

901
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,884
- One is moving in right now.
- Nick.

902
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:46,472
Would you please get off your fat ass
and change the channel?

903
01:36:46,598 --> 01:36:48,932
I know. It's tough.
Thank you.

904
01:36:49,059 --> 01:36:52,227
That's going to make things
even colder than they are right now.

905
01:36:52,312 --> 01:36:54,271
Now, 52...

906
01:37:11,164 --> 01:37:13,165
You guys go.

907
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:21,548
Thirty-second window.
I cut the power, you grab the kid.

908
01:37:21,633 --> 01:37:24,510
- Simple and clean. Got it?
- Got it.

909
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:27,471
So tell me.
How many?

910
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:32,101
Does it matter?

911
01:37:32,185 --> 01:37:35,145
- Should I go first?
- Okay.

912
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:39,483
I don't exactly keep count, but...

913
01:37:39,609 --> 01:37:41,527
I would say...

914
01:37:41,653 --> 01:37:44,363
- high 50s, low 60s.
- Mm-hmm.

915
01:37:46,116 --> 01:37:48,283
Been around the block, but...

916
01:37:48,368 --> 01:37:50,411
- you know, the important thing is...
- 312.

917
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:54,999
312?

918
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,004
- How?
- Some were two at a time.

919
01:38:06,344 --> 01:38:09,054
- Honey.
- I'm... I'm... I'm...

920
01:38:20,233 --> 01:38:22,276
Baby's in the crib.

921
01:38:24,446 --> 01:38:27,031
Are you counting
innocent bystanders?

922
01:38:33,204 --> 01:38:36,832
- Monitoring the perimeter?
- I checked the perimeter.

923
01:38:36,916 --> 01:38:39,668
- What about the police bands?
- I am on the police bands.

924
01:38:39,794 --> 01:38:41,920
- Connected to the main...
- This is not my first time.

925
01:38:43,548 --> 01:38:46,050
I think we've established that.

926
01:38:48,386 --> 01:38:50,387
All right.

927
01:38:52,724 --> 01:38:54,725
Turn left.

928
01:38:54,851 --> 01:38:56,560
Left, John.

929
01:38:56,686 --> 01:38:58,812
Left!

930
01:38:58,897 --> 01:39:02,274
You don't have to
talk to me like that. Okay?

931
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,319
- Be nice.
- Left, please?

932
01:39:05,403 --> 01:39:07,321
I can't go left. You see?

933
01:39:07,405 --> 01:39:10,074
There is no left. Look.

934
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,576
I have straight.
I have back the way I came.

935
01:39:12,702 --> 01:39:14,912
There's no left.
Which way do you want me to go?

936
01:39:15,038 --> 01:39:18,499
- Just stay there and wait for my mark.
- See what I'm sitting in?

937
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:20,918
See that?

938
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:23,504
- Take your time.
- Yeah. All right. Stay.

939
01:39:23,588 --> 01:39:25,589
Stay there.
Wait for my mark. I'll find it.

940
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:30,552
Wait for my mark.

941
01:39:34,933 --> 01:39:38,769
Almost there.
I don't know what happened. Just hold on.

942
01:39:46,277 --> 01:39:48,987
What are you... John, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

943
01:39:51,116 --> 01:39:53,617
Kill the lights on my signal.

944
01:39:54,619 --> 01:39:56,995
Now. Kill the lights.

945
01:39:57,872 --> 01:39:59,415
Jane, kill the lights.

946
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:01,750
- Hey. Who's that?
- Where?

947
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:04,795
No, no. Not now! Turn 'em back on!

948
01:40:04,921 --> 01:40:07,256
Idiot!

949
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:09,425
- Here they come.
- Hey, Nick. Uncuff me.

950
01:40:09,509 --> 01:40:11,218
Turn 'em on!
Turn 'em back on!

951
01:40:11,302 --> 01:40:13,929
Turn 'em back on!

952
01:40:15,682 --> 01:40:17,599
- Turn it back on.
- All right.

953
01:40:17,726 --> 01:40:20,644
- Give me light.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

954
01:40:23,815 --> 01:40:26,442
- Nick.
- Shut up.

955
01:40:30,488 --> 01:40:32,406
Give me a gun.

956
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:34,658
- Nick, give me a gun.
- Zip it!

957
01:40:57,932 --> 01:40:59,932
Open the door.

958
01:41:05,565 --> 01:41:07,524
Back there.

959
01:41:09,694 --> 01:41:12,321
Look out.
Move, move, move.

960
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:19,620
This guy's a wily one.

961
01:41:26,753 --> 01:41:28,587
Shut the door.

962
01:41:28,713 --> 01:41:31,465
Move. Move. The other way.

963
01:41:36,054 --> 01:41:38,138
How's this work?

964
01:41:40,558 --> 01:41:42,893
I told you to wait for my signal.

965
01:41:43,019 --> 01:41:45,145
- You didn't wait for my signal.
- Well, I improvised.

966
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:47,356
- You deviated from the plan.
- The plan was flawed.

967
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,817
- The plan was not flawed.
- Anal.

968
01:41:51,194 --> 01:41:54,029
- Organized.
- Jane, 90% of this job is instinct.

969
01:41:54,155 --> 01:41:56,323
Your instincts set off
every alarm in the building.

970
01:41:56,408 --> 01:41:58,951
My instincts got the job done.
May not have been the Jane show.

971
01:41:59,077 --> 01:42:02,871
No. It was the John show. It was half-assed.
Like Christmas. Like our anniversary.

972
01:42:02,997 --> 01:42:05,541
Like the time you forgot
to bring my mother's birthday present.

973
01:42:05,667 --> 01:42:10,587
- Your fake mother's birthday.
- The point is, you are always
the first to break team.

974
01:42:10,672 --> 01:42:13,632
You don't want a team. You...
You want a servant for hire.

975
01:42:13,758 --> 01:42:16,552
I want someone I can count on.

976
01:42:16,678 --> 01:42:19,346
- Jane, there's no air around you anymore.
- Oh.

977
01:42:19,431 --> 01:42:21,348
Okay. What is that
supposed to mean?

978
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:24,393
It means there's no room for mistakes.
No mistakes whatsoever.

979
01:42:24,477 --> 01:42:27,062
No spontaneity.
I mean, who can answer to that?

980
01:42:27,188 --> 01:42:30,566
Well, you don't have to. Do you?
'Cause this isn't even a real marriage.

981
01:42:32,861 --> 01:42:35,112
- Who are you people?
- Shut up!

982
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:39,283
Well.

983
01:42:39,409 --> 01:42:41,618
So, now I realize...

984
01:42:41,745 --> 01:42:44,455
you witnessed the missus and I
working through some domestic issues.

985
01:42:44,581 --> 01:42:46,790
- Oh.
- That's regrettable.

986
01:42:48,668 --> 01:42:52,212
But don't take that as a sign of weakness.
That would be a mistake on your part.

987
01:42:52,297 --> 01:42:54,882
Now tell us what you know.

988
01:42:54,966 --> 01:42:56,842
Why do both our bosses
want you dead?

989
01:42:59,304 --> 01:43:01,263
You unders...

990
01:43:01,389 --> 01:43:03,807
Honey, please.

991
01:43:05,226 --> 01:43:07,144
Wrap it up.

992
01:43:07,228 --> 01:43:11,065
Maybe it's not such a good idea
to undermine me in front of the hostage.

993
01:43:11,149 --> 01:43:13,400
Sends a mixed message.

994
01:43:13,485 --> 01:43:15,986
Sorry.

995
01:43:16,071 --> 01:43:18,030
Girls.

996
01:43:19,157 --> 01:43:21,033
Okay.

997
01:43:21,159 --> 01:43:23,619
- Where was I?
- "A mistake on your part."

998
01:43:23,745 --> 01:43:26,538
Shut up. Options.
I'm gonna lay out your options for you.

999
01:43:26,664 --> 01:43:28,916
- Okay? Option "A."
- If I could...

1000
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,293
Shut up.
Option "A."

1001
01:43:31,419 --> 01:43:34,338
You talk. We listen.
No pain.

1002
01:43:34,422 --> 01:43:36,757
Option "B."
You don't talk.

1003
01:43:36,841 --> 01:43:39,510
I remove your thumbs
with my pliers.

1004
01:43:39,636 --> 01:43:42,638
It will hurt.
Option "C."

1005
01:43:42,764 --> 01:43:47,685
I like to vary the details a bit,
but the punch line is you die.

1006
01:43:50,355 --> 01:43:52,272
- Benjamin.
- Okay.

1007
01:43:52,357 --> 01:43:55,984
- We're impatient people.
- Okay.

1008
01:44:00,198 --> 01:44:02,116
Can I get a soda?

1009
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,451
Or a juice or, uh, some...

1010
01:44:04,536 --> 01:44:08,664
"A." "A." Option "A." Aaah!

1011
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:11,542
- Oh, that hurt.
- Okay. That was a nice shot.

1012
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,966
- What's... You got a spasm?

1013
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:22,386
I'm tied up.
Why don't you check my back pocket?

1014
01:44:30,729 --> 01:44:33,022
I'm not the target. You are.

1015
01:44:33,148 --> 01:44:36,442
Both of you.
They found out you're married...

1016
01:44:36,568 --> 01:44:39,820
so they teamed up and sent you
to the same hit to target each other.

1017
01:44:39,904 --> 01:44:42,573
It was a joint task force
by both your companies.

1018
01:44:42,699 --> 01:44:46,785
Two competing agents living under
the same roof. It's bad for business.

1019
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:50,247
- They wanted you to take each other out.
- You were bait.

1020
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:54,710
Well, it's entry level.
Toehold into the company.

1021
01:44:54,836 --> 01:44:56,754
Couple hits,
they bump me up to a desk.

1022
01:44:56,838 --> 01:44:58,756
It's pretty cool actually.

1023
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,758
You keep the photo
in your back pocket?

1024
01:45:00,842 --> 01:45:03,886
- What was I supposed to do? Frame it?
- You get rid of it. You burn it.

1025
01:45:03,970 --> 01:45:06,263
- Tradecraft 101.
- I'm sorry. I guess I skipped that day.

1026
01:45:06,389 --> 01:45:09,099
Just like I guess you skipped the day
about not marrying the enemy.

1027
01:45:09,225 --> 01:45:12,519
You were bait,
or you are bait?

1028
01:45:16,858 --> 01:45:19,068
Belt. Belt. Belt, dude.

1029
01:45:26,618 --> 01:45:28,619
Two minutes.

1030
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,039
One minute.

1031
01:45:33,917 --> 01:45:36,293
I'll get you closer.

1032
01:45:57,399 --> 01:45:59,316
A little help.

1033
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:01,110
- Clear.
- Clear.

1034
01:46:02,904 --> 01:46:05,906
Hey, I think I chipped my tooth.
Do you know if we have dental?

1035
01:46:21,339 --> 01:46:24,133
My way out is a boat
standing by in La Paz.

1036
01:46:27,303 --> 01:46:30,305
Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?

1037
01:46:30,432 --> 01:46:32,975
So, at least, apart,
we know what the odds are.

1038
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,647
Let's just call this what it is...

1039
01:46:38,773 --> 01:46:40,691
and what it isn't.

1040
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:47,698
All right.
So it's a crap marriage.

1041
01:46:47,782 --> 01:46:50,701
All right. I'm a mess.
You're a disaster.

1042
01:46:50,827 --> 01:46:52,703
We're both liars.

1043
01:46:55,206 --> 01:46:57,124
But you run,
you'll always be running.

1044
01:47:00,837 --> 01:47:02,921
I say we stay and we fight.

1045
01:47:03,048 --> 01:47:05,215
We finish this thing.

1046
01:47:05,342 --> 01:47:08,093
Then if you wanna go, you can go.

1047
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:11,013
Oh, thank you.

1048
01:47:11,097 --> 01:47:14,892
What? "Let's call this what it is."
Jesus Christ.

1049
01:47:16,394 --> 01:47:18,270
- Stop.
- Don't.

1050
01:47:32,619 --> 01:47:34,328
Oh, Jesus.

1051
01:47:47,258 --> 01:47:48,884
This is
a really good store.

1052
01:48:33,513 --> 01:48:35,806
- See you in the next life, Jane.
- Likewise, John.

1053
01:50:19,244 --> 01:50:20,911
Sorry.

1054
01:50:24,749 --> 01:50:26,959
We'll talk about this later.

1055
01:50:41,766 --> 01:50:44,059
Jesus!

1056
01:50:45,645 --> 01:50:48,147
- I didn't touch a thing.
- Yes, you did.

1057
01:51:28,938 --> 01:51:32,149
- Sorry about the, uh, knife in...
- I don't want to talk about it.

1058
01:51:38,156 --> 01:51:40,115
- I'll fly.
- I'll be bait.

1059
01:51:41,576 --> 01:51:44,495
- I'm goin' clockwise, so watch my 6: 00.
- All right.

1060
01:52:44,889 --> 01:52:46,807
Go! Move!

1061
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:32,579
How's it look?

1062
01:54:35,875 --> 01:54:37,835
It's a piece of cake.

1063
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:50,097
Watch these.
They tend to jam. So watch 'em.

1064
01:54:52,559 --> 01:54:55,185
You favor your left, sweetheart,
so look out for right.

1065
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:12,202
Damn. That boat in La Paz
is lookin' pretty good right now, isn't it?

1066
01:55:16,875 --> 01:55:19,084
Well, it rains a lot this time of year.

1067
01:55:25,467 --> 01:55:27,968
Shut up.

1068
01:56:55,932 --> 01:56:59,184
I'm interested in the progress
you've made in the last few weeks.

1069
01:56:59,269 --> 01:57:01,186
Uh, doin' all right, aren't we?

1070
01:57:01,271 --> 01:57:03,188
I mean, listen.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1071
01:57:03,314 --> 01:57:05,399
There were times I just wanted to...

1072
01:57:05,525 --> 01:57:07,443
- Kill her, but, uh...
- Likewise.

1073
01:57:07,527 --> 01:57:09,445
Couldn't take the shot.

1074
01:57:09,529 --> 01:57:11,447
- That's a good sign.
- Who would've thought.

1075
01:57:11,531 --> 01:57:13,574
- Sometimes you have to battle through.
- Hmm.

1076
01:57:13,658 --> 01:57:16,618
- That's marriage, right?
- Yeah. You take your best shot and...

1077
01:57:18,496 --> 01:57:20,372
- Oh. We redid the house.
- Hmm.

1078
01:57:20,498 --> 01:57:22,458
We did. Yes, we did.

1079
01:57:22,542 --> 01:57:25,461
- You know, there will always be challenges.
- Uh-huh.

1080
01:57:25,545 --> 01:57:27,838
- Threats out there.
- Yep.

1081
01:57:27,964 --> 01:57:30,549
But you can handle it together.

1082
01:57:30,675 --> 01:57:34,511
- So far.
- Yes, we ca... So far?

1083
01:57:34,637 --> 01:57:37,097
Oh, what is that?

1084
01:57:37,182 --> 01:57:39,183
I'm leaving room for the unknown.

1085
01:57:39,309 --> 01:57:41,643
So far.

1086
01:57:41,728 --> 01:57:44,438
And do you feel that
your relationship styles...

1087
01:57:44,522 --> 01:57:47,608
- are more conducive to the free flow...
- Ask us the sex question.

1088
01:57:48,651 --> 01:57:50,527
John.

1089
01:57:51,696 --> 01:57:54,031
- Uh, well, that...
- Ten.
