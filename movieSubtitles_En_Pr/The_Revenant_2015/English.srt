2
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,846
It's okay, son...

3
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,357
I know you want this to be over.

4
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:22,105
I'm right here.

5
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,496
I will be right here...

6
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,108
But, you don't give up.

7
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,090
You hear me?

8
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:51,652
As long as you can still grab
a breath, you fight.

9
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:55,535
You breathe... keep breathing.

10
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:44,808
Hawk.

11
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:12,950
Calm.

12
00:04:31,494 --> 00:04:32,990
Oh shit!

13
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:37,606
God damn sons of bitches.

14
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,859
God shit me more.

15
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,939
- Hey you seen Coulter?
- No.

16
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:56,215
Listen up! When them pelts is clean...

17
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,042
I want you to wrap 'em up real tight.

18
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:02,542
Remember, We're not doin' no
15 pelt bales...

19
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,714
- We're doin' 30 pelt bales.
- Fitzgerald.

20
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,073
- Captain.
- Where are we with the haul?

21
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:09,687
What are you thinking?

22
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,859
Well...

23
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,882
I'm thinkin' whatever it is that
they're hunting out there...

24
00:05:13,907 --> 00:05:15,950
I'm hoping they don't need another shot.

25
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,857
Let's make sure we're at ahead by dawn.

26
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:19,315
We've been done by this morning.

27
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,143
I don't like to be not here myself by now,
but you know we're not.

28
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,705
We men are too tired.

29
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,244
I figure we're only few days out from
the Fort, we're trapped out.

30
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:26,628
All we have to worry about...

31
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:28,114
- is getting some fresh meat for the boys.
- Yeah.

32
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,379
Yeah, you seen Coulter?

33
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:35,975
- Hey, we took down an elk.

34
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:37,393
A big one.

35
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:40,147
We're gonna need some help
to haul the meat back.

36
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,063
You let me know when it's on the spit.

37
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:43,350
- I'll help with it then.

38
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:44,941
Hey no, come on fellas... I need your help.

39
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:47,709
We needed help when we were bustin'
are asses loadin' them bales.

40
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,617
I've been out here so long eating
this damn beaver meat...

41
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:52,942
I'm actually starting to
miss my wife's cooking.

42
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,008
Shit, I'm actually startin'
to miss your wife.

43
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:56,268
Why don't you shut the hell?...

44
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,255
- Help.

45
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:00,670
- Is that Coulter?

46
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:03,086
- Stay together.
- Jim, you go get the Captain.

47
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:04,750
Jesus Christ!

48
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:06,249
- Shut up!
- Help him!

49
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:11,454
- Anybody seeing them?
- Stay quiet dammit...

50
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:17,736
God damn.

51
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,088
What was that?

52
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,066
Pa?

53
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,208
Let's go.

54
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:57,499
They got Thomas.

55
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:23,489
I can't see 'em.

56
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,509
- Get down.
- Oh shit.

57
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:31,516
They are everywhere.

58
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:32,415
We are surrounded.

59
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,863
- They're everywhere.
- Soho...

60
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:36,361
Stay here.

61
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:38,545
No, no. Oh no!

62
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,382
Stay down. - Help me!

63
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,625
They want us out in the open...

64
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:50,042
Someone get up the hill!

65
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,637
Nobody move, just stay where you are.

66
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,211
Well they want the pelts.

67
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,916
We go and get on them 'bout right now...

68
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,048
or we gonna lose it all.

69
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:18,172
Get to the boat. To the boat, son.

70
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:20,674
Move, move, move.

71
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:27,225
Leave the forest, leave the forest...

72
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,383
To the boat.

73
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,974
Hawk!

74
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:04,640
Hawk, Hawk!

75
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,364
Grab some pelts!

76
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:36,333
Come on, grab the pelt!

77
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,371
Grab the pelt.

78
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:59,077
Come on.

79
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:01,269
Come on.

80
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,061
Get this to my little girl.
You're coming with us I'm gettin' help...

81
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:34,308
Lean on me, just get...

82
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:38,812
Glass!

83
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:40,060
Get to the boat!

84
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:03,533
You fuckin' son of a...

85
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,294
Get on the fuckin' boat.

86
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:18,122
Help.

87
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:24,537
Move, come on.

88
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:29,238
Come on.

89
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:31,831
- Cut the rope.

90
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:33,213
- Cut the rope.
- Wait for Amos, wait for Amos...

91
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,137
We go now.

92
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:38,305
Go to the cannon.

93
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:51,350
Don't leave, please.

94
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,473
My daughter, Powaqa, is not here.

95
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,104
Collect all the pelts we can carry.

96
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:46,915
We'll trade pelts with French for horses

97
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,957
and we will keep searching for her.

98
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:54,623
And the dust becomes flower...

99
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:55,585
Amen.

100
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,423
When the morning was clear...

101
00:13:00,957 --> 00:13:03,460
Amen.

102
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:17,625
Ready?

103
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,689
Hold still.

104
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,215
Where did you learn that?

105
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,291
My father was a doctor.

106
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:33,571
- Bridger.
- Captain we got a small tree niggers out here...

107
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,037
Waiting to finish the job.

108
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:36,326
- Hold there.
- Yes.

109
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,859
Tell me you got some kind of plan.

110
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:47,522
Glass.

111
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,390
Missouri is no good.

112
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,900
Not while the Rees runnin' it.

113
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,586
We got to get off this boat...

114
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,236
Oh you want to get off the boat?

115
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,677
Then what we're gonna do, hah?

116
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,787
We're gonna take our furs...

117
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:05,376
And sit out there amongst the Ree,
like a bunch of god damn ducks.

118
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:08,142
Only safe thing to do is track a new course

119
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,277
back upon land.

120
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:10,591
We'll add weeks to the trip.

121
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:12,871
Better then floating back down there where
they can get their eyes on us.

122
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,109
They got eyes on you right now, son.

123
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:19,045
What I'm saying is we stay on the boat.

124
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,761
Try the course toward the Fort...

125
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,639
We take the chances on the water.

126
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,384
Glass knows this territory better than
the rest of us put together.

127
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:28,192
It's his job to get us home safe.

128
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:29,572
- Get us home safe?
- Yeah.

129
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,036
- Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?

130
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,987
- 33 now.

131
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,481
They were my men Fitzgerald,
I know how many I lost.

132
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,028
We do like Glass says,
that's the end of it.

133
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,165
We have to set the boat loose.

134
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:57,466
If Ree are tracking us, they will find it
down the river.

135
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,744
The best course is hike in on the ground
and follow it down...

136
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,481
to Fort Kahowa.

137
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:02,638
- What, on foot?
- Are you sure?

138
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:04,805
It'd be a week before we get there.

139
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,353
Unless we come across a poach straying
prison horses.

140
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:08,908
Ain't no poach that far over.

141
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:10,384
Right, Captain.

142
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:12,900
Losing this boat is god damn stinking.

143
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:14,989
Besides the Rees ain't that stupid...

144
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:17,793
If we keep it, we can lay
it up around hours peak.

145
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,879
Quit acting like you know what you're
talking about Fitzgerald.

146
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:21,076
Ain't nobody talking to you.

147
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,031
Who'd listen to you anyway.

148
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:26,565
God damn, can't even ...find fuckin...
potato shit...

149
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:27,459
All I'm sayin' is...

150
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:29,720
camp Roollin is just up away...

151
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,392
And we can hold up there.

152
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:33,536
We walk.

153
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:36,120
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

154
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:41,522
God damn, wish my daddy was a doctor then
he could have bought me a captains job.

155
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:42,988
So what do we do now?

156
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,956
Praying that poach ain't rockin'
if we ever get back here...

157
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,966
- to pick them up.
- Make sure to mark this place.

158
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,314
We're leaving a fortune under these rocks.

159
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:52,490
No more room here, you
gotta move up the hill.

160
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:54,538
- Glass. Chart a course...

161
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,880
Try as you can figure to
get us around the reef.

162
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:57,825
- Yes sir.

163
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:02,769
- This ain't right, this ain't right.

164
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:06,538
We all know that this furs ain't won't
be here by the time we come back.

165
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:08,359
There is no way we can hold
them all the way back...

166
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:09,261
to the Fort.

167
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,309
Not the way we're going, besides Arikara is

168
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,715
spread all through their territory,
we want to go with our hands free.

169
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,493
I'm tryin' to tell you're gonna
lose this pelts.

170
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,290
- Would you rather hold on to the pelts
or your life?

171
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:18,224
Life?

172
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:21,038
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.

173
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:24,625
I just got livin' the only way I get
to do that is through this pelts.

174
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:27,506
Fuck!

175
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,341
Calm there Fitz.

176
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:32,811
Make a way, I'm going home...

177
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:35,519
After six months working my ass
of like a mule,

178
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,250
risking my neck...

179
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:39,015
Men dying and for what?

180
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:40,700
Damn nearly lost everything.

181
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:42,439
This job's been fucked from the start.

182
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,454
There is the one being fuckin' us.

183
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:49,866
Any of you boys wonder how Ree managed
to get their drop on us

184
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,031
for Mr. Glass here,

185
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,208
was supposed to be looking out for
that fucking thing.

186
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:57,509
All them Pawnee buddies of his. - Pawnees
as much against Rees as the rest of us.

187
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,397
Yeah?

188
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,424
What about his little...

189
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:03,213
half-breed son?

190
00:17:04,128 --> 00:17:06,519
And what kind of savage you think
his momma was.

191
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:07,971
Lay of the boy Fitz.

192
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:10,458
All I'm saying here.

193
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:13,589
Savage is savage...

194
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:22,865
Hey Glass.

195
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:27,470
Is it true what they say?
That you shootin' a lieutenant...

196
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:29,214
While you was living with them savages?

197
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:30,319
Fitzgerald.

198
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:36,360
21 dead soldiers, more than
40 dead feather necks...

199
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:38,474
But you and your boy are the only ones
to get walk out alive.

200
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:40,491
It was kind of a miracle, don't you think?

201
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:41,974
You need to shut up Fitzgerald.

202
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:45,151
Is that what you did?

203
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:47,766
Shot one of your own to save this little
dog right here?

204
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,313
- Shut up.
- You want to fight son?

205
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,821
You were playing with
this little boy's momma?

206
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,887
- Fitzgerald!
- Need to kill her?

207
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:57,730
Hey you can quit polishing that rifle,
while I'm talking to you.

208
00:17:58,636 --> 00:17:59,738
I'm working on it.

209
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,562
You can work on it later
when I'm done talking to you.

210
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,987
- Look at me scalp.
- That's enough!

211
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,352
You're forgettin' your place boy.

212
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:13,954
As far as I can tell my place is right
here, on the smart end of this rifle.

213
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,055
You move along Fitzgerald.

214
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,278
That's an order.

215
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:20,842
Listen to me.

216
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:22,995
We only have a couple hours of light left.

217
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,123
We gotta stash these pelts...

218
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,664
And get rid of the boat, let's go.

219
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,906
Yes, Captain.

220
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:31,291
I told you to be invisible, son.

221
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,186
- At least...
- If you want to survive keep your...

222
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,930
mouth shut.

223
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:39,709
- At least he heard me...
- They don't hear your voice!

224
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,803
They just see the color of your face.

225
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,862
You understand?

226
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,234
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

227
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:53,080
You have to listen to me, son.

228
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:55,383
You have to listen.

229
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,892
Beckett.

230
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:12,462
Weston.

231
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:14,181
Why are they not jumping?

232
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,838
It looks like they changed their minds.

233
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:24,893
Smart sons of bitches.

234
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,158
Smart...

235
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:35,626
I ought to be on that boat.

236
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:40,930
You did the right thing.

237
00:19:58,045 --> 00:19:59,312
It's time to move.

238
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,501
Get up.

239
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:03,780
We're headed out.

240
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:08,106
I'm coming.

241
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:13,368
It's better you lay down.

242
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:17,752
When the rest of the
men are ready you send them to me.

243
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,355
I'm going West.

244
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,418
You are my son.

245
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,580
You are my son.

246
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:54,478
There are only two here.

247
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:56,178
Powaqa is not here.

248
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:00,804
The others probably took her.

249
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,548
They went north.

250
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:08,777
We'll pick up their tracks
on the mountain.

251
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,192
Was it the right decision...

252
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:19,605
Leaving the boat?

253
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,169
Ree own that river.

254
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,168
Would have flanked us.

255
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:27,092
If we stay east to the ground
to those mountains...

256
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:29,005
We cut a week of our trip.

257
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:31,351
Land is all dry up there,
nothing for the Ree to hunt.

258
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,239
- Except us?
- Except us.

259
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,839
Is it true what Fitzgerald said?

260
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,879
Is that why you came out here
to the edge of the world?

261
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,836
Glass?
I didn't like the quiet.

262
00:21:57,283 --> 00:22:00,179
Your boy, he's seen a lot...

263
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,726
He got a mother you need
to get him back to?

264
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,686
Glass!?
Hey there are cubs here.

265
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:08,757
¡Glass!

266
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,647
We got cubs here.

267
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:18,529
Christ almighty.

268
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,201
Hey you.

269
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:22,938
Hey!

270
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,593
He's down here.

271
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:28,168
- Help me out...
- Keep your eyes open, the bear's alive.

272
00:29:28,497 --> 00:29:30,072
Come on, I need your help now.

273
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,176
Glass.

274
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:34,968
Oh my god!

275
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,349
- Oh Christ!
- Captain.

276
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,549
Give me rags now!

277
00:29:40,376 --> 00:29:41,771
Push where he bleeds out.

278
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:44,995
Prepare the kit.

279
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:47,212
Bridger, you hold that.

280
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:49,834
- Easy.
- Oh God!

281
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:52,936
- Gotta give him credit for taking
that Grizz down with him.

282
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,886
He shouldn't have fire the shot, the whole
place is crawling with fucking tree niggers...

283
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,097
- Hey that's enough, that's enough!

284
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:00,679
- We're still on Ree territory here...

285
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:02,642
This is one of our own men, god dammit.

286
00:30:03,495 --> 00:30:06,174
- The boy leave him, just
got a circle around us.

287
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:08,071
North and west, take those two with you.

288
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,294
Bill, Fryman you take South and East.

289
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,588
Watch for anyone that might
have heard that shot.

290
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,601
- Yes sir.
- We have to stitch him up.

291
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:16,106
What about me?

292
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:18,069
It's alright.

293
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:19,353
You have to... - You stay here.

294
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,959
- Hold it down.
- I'm sorry Mr. Glass. I am so sorry.

295
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,178
- Bridger, hold him. Press down here.

296
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:27,761
He is bleeding down here too.

297
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,967
Torturing the bastard.

298
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:35,595
The proper thing to do would be though...
Finish him off quick.

299
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:38,594
Unless he has a chance of pulling through.

300
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:44,792
Pullin' thru? You saw what
that Grizz did to him.

301
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:46,813
He'll be dead inside an hour.

302
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:51,855
Yeah, we all will be if we don't quit
waving like that.

303
00:30:55,874 --> 00:30:58,063
Towards you and toward that place.
I'll hold him. Go.

304
00:30:58,935 --> 00:31:00,196
Hold him, you go.

305
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:03,419
Go! Now!

306
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:11,181
- He past out.
- Very good.

307
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,876
I'm gonna take advantage and stitch up,
let me see.

308
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:14,935
Oh God!

309
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,271
Water.

310
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,016
Bridger, go tell the others we'll
camp here tonight.

311
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:28,420
- I'm right here.
- Yes, sir.

312
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,716
I'll be right here...

313
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:48,018
Toussaint, he's here.

314
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,869
I thought he wouldn't make it.

315
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:53,753
I'm glad you made it here.

316
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:59,315
We need horses and rifles.

317
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:01,818
We bring you many pelts.

318
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,644
No horses... just what we agreed.

319
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,252
Take all the pelts you want.

320
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,929
We need horses and rifles.

321
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,228
I need a woman with big tits...

322
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,510
Who can cook.

323
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:20,573
We can't give you any horses.

324
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:23,088
What's he saying?

325
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,338
I don't know, something about horses.

326
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:25,508
Bring us something to drink... some whisky.

327
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:26,454
.

328
00:32:28,435 --> 00:32:29,877
Tell him to stop asking about the horses.

329
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:34,837
Always good doing business with you.

330
00:32:35,106 --> 00:32:36,196
Horses.

331
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:38,033
No horses.

332
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:41,069
All we can trade are guns and ammunition.

333
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:43,910
Tell him if he asks about horses again,
there is no deal.

334
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:47,382
Where did you get these? The Americans?

335
00:32:47,408 --> 00:32:49,010
...

336
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:51,071
They're already branded

337
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:55,011
I'll only be able to get
half price for them.

338
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,743
Get him away from there.

339
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:00,547
I said no horses.

340
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,612
We'll take these three horses.

341
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:04,665
I'm not going to say it again.

342
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:06,543
They aren't part of the deal.

343
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,445
Now tell your man to step away.

344
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:10,453
We had an agreement, you have to honor it.

345
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:16,847
<i>In French</i>
You stand there and talk to me about honor?

346
00:33:17,502 --> 00:33:19,217
I told you he speaks French.

347
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:23,331
Those pelts are stolen.

348
00:33:26,524 --> 00:33:27,523
.

349
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:31,603
You all have stolen everything from us.

350
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:35,245
Everything!

351
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,075
The land.

352
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,964
The animals.

353
00:33:40,438 --> 00:33:44,609
Two white men snuck into our village,
and took my daughter, Powaqa.

354
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:49,385
.

355
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:54,523
We leave you these pelts because honor
demands it

356
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,649
I take your horses to find my daughter.

357
00:33:58,324 --> 00:34:00,713
You are free to try and stop me.

358
00:34:01,014 --> 00:34:02,519
.

359
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:08,640
Business is business.

360
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:13,943
Prepare five horses for them.

361
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:23,126
I want everybody up at the crack of dawn.

362
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:24,356
Yes sir. Understood Cap.

363
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,347
Carrying Glass would be hard.

364
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,371
We need to get ahead as far as possible.

365
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:31,993
We'll divide into two groups.

366
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:37,542
Fitzgerald, Jones, Fryman. You
take the east side of the river.

367
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,953
Anderson you scout up front.

368
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:44,264
- That claw don't mourn him.
- Everybody else takes turn carrying Glass.

369
00:34:44,454 --> 00:34:45,514
Yes, Captain.

370
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,667
They're ain't for me.

371
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:29,581
.

372
00:35:31,603 --> 00:35:32,993
Do not let him into the water...

373
00:35:33,103 --> 00:35:34,073
Get up.

374
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:37,215
- Fuck off.
- That's an order!

375
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:02,939
God dammit, don't let him down!

376
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:04,777
Don't let him down.

377
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:17,796
Watch it.

378
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:20,295
How are we gonna make it up there?

379
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:21,645
Slow down a bit.

380
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,617
It's killing us Captain.

381
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,525
Lift him Bridger.

382
00:36:34,414 --> 00:36:36,097
Keep it steady...

383
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:39,501
Everybody.

384
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,337
And here...

385
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:43,769
I'm gonna go up and pull...

386
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,518
Here...

387
00:36:48,662 --> 00:36:49,779
Hold it.

388
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:56,659
Enough of this shit. We'll never make it
across land this way.

389
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:58,941
He is burning out Captain.

390
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:03,169
Captain you ain't doing us nor him...

391
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:06,805
no favor... going on
suffering like this.

392
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,922
Captain!

393
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:12,513
Captain, it's all the same up here.
We have to go back.

394
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,570
Find another way.

395
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:19,688
Hold on.

396
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,144
Glass...
Hugh...

397
00:37:25,637 --> 00:37:27,652
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

398
00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:30,990
Plant that rag over his eyes Mr. Bridger.

399
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:32,622
- What?
- Sir, I can't.

400
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:34,116
Plant that rag over his eyes.

401
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,586
- What, wait.
- Sorry Hugh.

402
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,171
- Wait. - Sir, I can't do that.
- How do we get back without him?

403
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,025
- He's the only one who knows the way.
- He can't go any further.

404
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,342
- Wave that rag over his eyes.
- Wait.

405
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:43,315
Sir, I can't.

406
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:44,379
Wait, you can't...

407
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,114
Put a rag over his eyes.

408
00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:50,386
Lay it over his eyes.

409
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:52,366
Step back.

410
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:57,561
Stop, Mr. Henry...

411
00:37:58,138 --> 00:37:59,440
Henry, please.

412
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,889
Captain, Captain...

413
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,070
Hey, Hawk!

414
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,463
Calm down kid.

415
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:05,876
Calm down.

416
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:12,552
Henry, please...

417
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:15,945
There's a $70 bonus in the
Rocky Mountains Fur Company...

418
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:17,516
for two men, who stays...

419
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:19,395
back with Glass, to see this through.

420
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,954
- I'll stay.
- Me too.

421
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:22,257
Money or not, I'll stay.

422
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:25,176
I need a third.

423
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,754
Sorry Captain, I have family...

424
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:29,996
I am not crazy.

425
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:34,284
Captain, three men can't
hold off a party of Ree.

426
00:38:34,308 --> 00:38:35,560
Much less boys.

427
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,323
Besides, $70 ain't going
by nobody lose their ears.

428
00:38:39,347 --> 00:38:40,449
100 then.

429
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:43,264
This man is the only
reason we're still alive.

430
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:48,090
Oh Captain, we were 45 men when we started,
now we're 10, almost 9.

431
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:50,305
- He's my father, you can have my share.

432
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,426
- Mine too.

433
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,714
- Have our share also.

434
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:58,633
Alright.

435
00:38:59,394 --> 00:39:02,485
Alright, if Mr. Bridger feels the same way,
then I'll lead behind of them.

436
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:03,573
- You?
- Yeah.

437
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:06,196
You already lost my share of the pelts...

438
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,928
So I don't got much choice but to try
make it up some other means.

439
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:12,874
Besides, sticking around for another
day or two don't make no difference.

440
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,697
$300, is to get to go home with something.

441
00:39:15,783 --> 00:39:17,660
Glass is to be cared for until...

442
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:18,610
Understood?

443
00:39:18,925 --> 00:39:20,599
Yeah. You have my word, understand.

444
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:26,193
You boys get him down of this slope
there somewhere safe before the dark.

445
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:27,607
You heard the boys.

446
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:28,986
- Fitzgerald.
- Captain.

447
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:33,152
Glass is to be cared for
as long as necessary.

448
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,607
And a proper burial when it's time.
He's earned it.

449
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,309
Understand.

450
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,950
Can you hear the wind, Father?

451
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:06,282
Remember what mother
used to say about wind?

452
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:14,793
The wind cannot defeat a
tree with strong roots.

453
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:20,685
You are still breathing...

454
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:28,129
I miss her so much.

455
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:50,920
I will be right here...

456
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:55,233
I'm right here.

457
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:04,511
As long as you can still
grab a breath, you fight.

458
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:08,918
You breathe. Keep breathing.

459
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:12,759
When there is a storm...

460
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:20,960
And you stand in front of a tree...

461
00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:32,289
If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall.

462
00:41:42,423 --> 00:41:50,360
But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.

463
00:42:32,293 --> 00:42:35,186
$300 goes alongway toward retiring...

464
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:38,633
Way down to Texas, buy me
a decent piece of land...

465
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,354
And start pissing in the wind.

466
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,042
Getting the hell out of
this godforsaken places.

467
00:42:48,882 --> 00:42:50,200
- Did Ree done that to you?

468
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:53,401
- I was just asking.

469
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:56,021
They done it.

470
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:59,375
They took their sweet (?) with it too.

471
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:01,909
At the start I didn't feel nothing,

472
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,650
I just heard the sound of...

473
00:43:04,062 --> 00:43:06,253
knife scraping against
my skull, you know...

474
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,738
They were all laughin' and whoopin'
and hollerin' what not...

475
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,082
Then the blood came...

476
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:17,040
The cold started streaming down
my face and my eyes...

477
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:19,369
The breathing it in...

478
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:21,290
choking on it.

479
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:24,764
That's when I felt it.

480
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:27,107
I felt all of it.

481
00:43:28,513 --> 00:43:30,434
They got my head turned inside out.

482
00:43:31,955 --> 00:43:32,641
Jesus.

483
00:43:33,058 --> 00:43:35,050
Yeah, them Indians down Texas way...

484
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:37,553
they may rob you,
ain't gonna take your topknot.

485
00:43:39,649 --> 00:43:40,858
When was it?

486
00:43:44,297 --> 00:43:47,890
God damn, will you just,
would you quit that noise now, will ya?

487
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,226
Or just... Leave it.

488
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:20,550
I'm following further back from heading against
the boys on account of tending to you.

489
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:27,911
We got to get up that damn mountain but
the wind keeps chasing us down.

490
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:32,535
If you're ready...

491
00:44:32,793 --> 00:44:34,337
Take the sacrament.

492
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:37,047
I can do that for you.

493
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:44,582
What you holding to Glass?

494
00:44:48,543 --> 00:44:49,655
You know?

495
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:51,859
Would be better...

496
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:55,106
If you would've take that last
breath of yours now.

497
00:44:55,687 --> 00:44:56,869
For all of us.

498
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,541
You hung tough.

499
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:03,050
That's something.

500
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,931
I'm begging you Glass.

501
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:08,469
Them Ree, they are so close now
I can smell them...

502
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:10,645
and I know you can smell them to,
when you got to think.

503
00:45:10,695 --> 00:45:12,092
You gotta think of your boy.

504
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,846
Alright? Cause you're gonna kill him.

505
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,534
You'll kill all of us.

506
00:45:24,036 --> 00:45:25,764
I can muzzle you if you like.

507
00:45:26,437 --> 00:45:28,744
Take away the suffering,
really quick and easy...

508
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,845
No one has to know that you give up.
I do that.

509
00:45:32,484 --> 00:45:34,269
All you gotta to do is blink...

510
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:35,552
If you want me to do that.

511
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:43,931
Save your boy and blink.

512
00:45:54,123 --> 00:45:55,892
You just have to blink.

513
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:02,362
Yeah.

514
00:46:02,397 --> 00:46:03,452
Oh yes!

515
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:07,276
You best hope that the good Lord
get his ass here quick, huh.

516
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:13,900
Maybe he'll forgive your sins, you know
maybe he won't...

517
00:46:14,073 --> 00:46:16,091
You just sudden commend it
to the Lord.

518
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:21,391
Through Jesus Christ, the Lord
of all reality and mercy...

519
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:28,095
Get away. Get away.

520
00:46:28,677 --> 00:46:31,651
You ok? Jim. Jim... Help.

521
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:45,915
- Help.
- Calm down. Alright, you don't understand.

522
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,702
- Don't shout, you'll get us all fuckin' killed.
- Keep away.

523
00:46:50,832 --> 00:46:53,535
I'll tell Jim and the Captain what you did
and they'll hang you.

524
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:56,012
- You have to understand this...
- They'll hang you...

525
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,527
Jim help. Jim get over here.

526
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:00,606
Keep quiet!!

527
00:47:15,253 --> 00:47:16,266
Shit.

528
00:48:17,576 --> 00:48:18,826
Got one beaver half.

529
00:48:21,241 --> 00:48:22,562
His breathing changed?

530
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:25,810
I ain't noticed.

531
00:48:27,797 --> 00:48:29,193
Damn, he's cold as ice.

532
00:48:31,281 --> 00:48:34,130
Here Mr. Glass... This will help...

533
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:36,154
It will keep you warm.

534
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:38,056
It's alright.

535
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:41,109
Where is Hawk?

536
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,203
He ain't with you?

537
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:47,492
- No.
- No?

538
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:54,762
I understand Mr. Glass.

539
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,397
Alright.

540
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,642
I think I'm gonna get a fire going.

541
00:48:58,844 --> 00:49:00,787
Yeah, sounds like a good idea.

542
00:49:07,768 --> 00:49:08,668
Hawk!

543
00:49:09,276 --> 00:49:12,193
You killed my son.

544
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:13,210
Hawk!

545
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:39,301
Bridge, there's about 20
of them down by the creek.

546
00:49:40,038 --> 00:49:41,285
They're headed this way.

547
00:49:41,676 --> 00:49:43,387
Now grab your shit and let's go.

548
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:47,580
Shit. Wait. What do we do?

549
00:49:47,994 --> 00:49:49,421
- Run right now.

550
00:49:49,806 --> 00:49:52,494
- What about Hawk?
- He ain't our problem no more.

551
00:49:53,446 --> 00:49:54,635
We can't just leave him here.

552
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,434
- He's going to be scalped.

553
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,749
If that Ree can find us, can't he?

554
00:49:58,784 --> 00:50:00,469
- Wait. What about Glass?

555
00:50:00,676 --> 00:50:03,170
He ain't our problem no more,
he is like us, he's on his own.

556
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:06,192
No, no, we made a promise to Captain...

557
00:50:06,285 --> 00:50:07,797
I'll give him a proper burial
when the time is needed.

558
00:50:07,865 --> 00:50:09,141
Well he needs that rifle.

559
00:50:09,665 --> 00:50:12,064
He can't do nothing with it if
you tarred it to his hands.

560
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:13,859
Now come on get your shit. Let's go.

561
00:50:13,986 --> 00:50:15,251
No, no, we can't do this.

562
00:50:15,895 --> 00:50:18,806
- We got no fucking choice.
- We can't. Look at him.

563
00:50:21,703 --> 00:50:23,502
- Alright, shitting brain...
- What you doin?

564
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,112
Can you take him? Come on.

565
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:27,524
No, no wait...

566
00:50:29,683 --> 00:50:31,247
Easy, slowly Fitz...

567
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:32,271
Easy.

568
00:50:33,373 --> 00:50:36,029
- I can't...
- Damn...

569
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:37,998
Shit, get this shit.

570
00:50:38,529 --> 00:50:39,326
- Wait, hold...

571
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:40,353
- Hold on!

572
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:45,524
Shut up.

573
00:50:46,228 --> 00:50:47,385
- Hold on.

574
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:51,527
- Fitz...

575
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,680
- What are you doing?
- What it looks like I'm doing?

576
00:50:54,474 --> 00:50:55,616
A proper burial.

577
00:50:55,706 --> 00:50:56,633
Like he wanted.

578
00:50:56,986 --> 00:50:59,337
- No, not like this.
- Why not?

579
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,390
- He is alive Fitz. He's alive.

580
00:51:05,656 --> 00:51:06,786
So shoot him.

581
00:51:19,831 --> 00:51:21,742
I have to go, I have to...

582
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:25,028
I'm sorry.

583
00:51:26,303 --> 00:51:27,558
I'm sorry.

584
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:44,434
Captain, this way...

585
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,684
There's a path down here.

586
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:49,815
There's no way through down here.

587
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,322
There ain't shit down there,
we go climb over.

588
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:56,117
- Cross can go to hell.

589
00:51:58,062 --> 00:52:00,082
- What does the map say?
- Keep climbing.

590
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,602
We climb Captain.

591
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:03,473
We keep climbing.

592
00:52:03,718 --> 00:52:05,225
Until we reach our gate.

593
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:10,646
Climb.

594
00:52:12,606 --> 00:52:13,869
- You got away from Murph?
- Yeah.

595
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:15,522
- You wait for it.

596
00:52:16,919 --> 00:52:17,766
- Captain.

597
00:52:21,078 --> 00:52:24,200
- Sir. Murphy says there's
a way down there.

598
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:26,352
- Who we following?

599
00:52:26,448 --> 00:52:27,858
- You follow who you want.

600
00:52:27,893 --> 00:52:29,059
- I'm going up.

601
00:52:30,724 --> 00:52:34,222
We all need to be going up.
Blair, come here!

602
00:55:56,613 --> 00:56:00,674
I'm not leaving you, son.

603
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,830
I'm right here.

604
00:57:10,647 --> 00:57:11,968
Fire's done.

605
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:15,136
I can't still feel my feet...

606
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,476
Besides, didn't we put enough distance
between us and them Ree anyhow?

607
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,309
Well...

608
00:57:21,492 --> 00:57:23,667
a dozen Ree could still made
twice the good time as we can.

609
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:25,234
- 20.
- What?

610
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:29,564
I thought you said that
you saw 20 Ree before.

611
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:31,166
Yeah, what you talking about?

612
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,787
You woke me up?

613
00:57:37,696 --> 00:57:39,631
You said you saw 20 Ree down by the creek.

614
00:57:40,077 --> 00:57:43,013
Well yeah, 20 or dozen, it don't matter...

615
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:44,505
I wasn't gonna exactly
hang around the creek

616
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,116
counting fuckin' feathers, now would I?

617
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,770
Matter a fact.

618
00:57:53,057 --> 00:57:55,178
What was you doing down by the creek
all by yourself?

619
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,239
I thought I already brought
up plenty of water.

620
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:01,357
Hey!

621
00:58:02,843 --> 00:58:04,673
Answer me Fitzgerald, I
asked you a question.

622
00:58:06,492 --> 00:58:09,127
Don't go questioning me now on the
account of fact that we all feel...

623
00:58:09,151 --> 00:58:11,704
- guilty about leaving this Glass behind.
- Answer me or I'm gonna blow your head off.

624
00:58:11,895 --> 00:58:13,540
You got a short memory boy.

625
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,958
Your ass is still be floatin around
Missouri right now...

626
00:58:16,982 --> 00:58:18,116
If it wasn't for me.

627
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,948
Now wanna ask questions...

628
00:58:22,648 --> 00:58:24,420
What you want ask if
you won't know asking.

629
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:29,457
You want to know why you left Mr.Glass
back there for dead, hah?

630
00:58:30,178 --> 00:58:31,246
Maybe...

631
00:58:31,507 --> 00:58:36,354
while you left your little boy friend wandering around, you
don't know if he's still alive yet. That what you want to know?

632
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:38,836
I'll tell you lies 'cause
you ain't a man yet.

633
00:58:39,501 --> 00:58:41,498
Alright? Because you were scared shitless

634
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:42,915
and you're scared now.
Now put your rifle down.

635
00:58:43,225 --> 00:58:45,071
- The Ree.
- What off it?

636
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:48,740
Tell me right now and be honest.
Did you see 'em?

637
00:58:48,764 --> 00:58:50,257
- Put your rifle down.
- Did you see the Ree?

638
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:54,063
No.

639
00:58:55,415 --> 00:58:56,815
Not a single one.

640
00:58:59,755 --> 00:59:01,189
- You fucking lie to me?

641
00:59:01,711 --> 00:59:02,958
- You lie to me!

642
00:59:07,113 --> 00:59:09,314
I had to scare some sense into you boy.

643
00:59:10,084 --> 00:59:12,404
Now Glass was dead, Hawk
we don't know about...

644
00:59:12,484 --> 00:59:14,723
There is no point either of us
dying here... Do you understand?

645
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:17,741
The way I see it, I saved
your life twice now son.

646
00:59:17,765 --> 00:59:19,313
I ought to be God to you...

647
00:59:20,689 --> 00:59:23,654
And God giveth, God taketh away.

648
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:28,828
Shit.

649
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:32,367
Fuck.

650
00:59:33,959 --> 00:59:35,728
Next time, if you want to shoot somebody...

651
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:38,780
you might wanna use, you
might wanna use powder.

652
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,527
Prime your rifle.

653
00:59:43,738 --> 00:59:44,591
Come on...

654
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:47,492
let's get up. Grab your shit.

655
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:51,592
Fresh blood. This could be Powaqa.

656
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:05,443
A dead guy.

657
01:04:14,441 --> 01:04:15,839
A Pawnee boy.

658
01:04:16,837 --> 01:04:17,909
Let's go.

659
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:33,515
Captain wait...

660
01:14:27,091 --> 01:14:29,546
- Who did this?
- I don't know.

661
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:40,146
Could be Captain Leavenworth boys.

662
01:14:42,746 --> 01:14:43,703
Hmm, yeah.

663
01:14:44,808 --> 01:14:46,757
You put some eyes on the back of your head.

664
01:14:50,383 --> 01:14:53,143
These Indians ain't never as dead as you'll
think they are.

665
01:14:54,395 --> 01:14:57,608
Look at them, they're
always stinking of shit.

666
01:15:34,682 --> 01:15:36,084
We got horses over here.

667
01:15:40,843 --> 01:15:41,954
Alright, Bridger.

668
01:15:47,726 --> 01:15:48,818
We got horses.

669
01:15:55,015 --> 01:15:56,753
What you wanna do about this pigs?

670
01:16:04,221 --> 01:16:05,878
Lord is on our side kid.

671
01:16:14,874 --> 01:16:15,914
You alright there kid?

672
01:16:16,758 --> 01:16:17,957
You're head in the right place?

673
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,139
I guess.

674
01:16:25,754 --> 01:16:28,014
- Can't help thinking about whether we did the right...
- No.

675
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:30,182
Ain't our place to wonder.

676
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:33,450
Good Lord's got us on the road, whether we
chose or not.

677
01:16:37,595 --> 01:16:40,420
My Pa being one ...wasn't a
religious man you, you know?

678
01:16:40,935 --> 01:16:43,033
If you couldn't grow it,
or kill it or eat it...

679
01:16:43,275 --> 01:16:45,537
then he just plain all didn't
believe in it and that was it.

680
01:16:46,874 --> 01:16:49,855
And this one time he hit
on up the old Saber hills.

681
01:16:50,114 --> 01:16:51,402
San Saber Hills...

682
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:55,848
Joined up with a couple of Texan range
buddies of his to hunt, you know.

683
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,572
Pretty routine, you know, they done it
like hundred times before.

684
01:16:59,663 --> 01:17:04,603
Should have been three days of kill, but
on Saturday, well it all went fucked.

685
01:17:05,215 --> 01:17:07,548
Somehow that night he
has to lose buddies...

686
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:08,890
And on top of it all...

687
01:17:09,548 --> 01:17:12,327
The Comanche's they went
and took the horses, so...

688
01:17:12,704 --> 01:17:14,111
He was starving,

689
01:17:14,135 --> 01:17:15,405
delirious...

690
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,611
And crawls up into this mud...

691
01:17:19,244 --> 01:17:22,158
Like the group of trees out there
in the middle of nowhere...

692
01:17:22,252 --> 01:17:24,771
just sticking up in
this ocean of scrub...

693
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:26,568
And he found religion.

694
01:17:27,924 --> 01:17:29,218
At that moment...

695
01:17:29,242 --> 01:17:30,336
he told me...

696
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,206
He found God.

697
01:17:39,612 --> 01:17:41,100
It turns out...

698
01:17:41,393 --> 01:17:42,561
The God...

699
01:17:44,037 --> 01:17:45,298
He is a squirrel.

700
01:17:46,617 --> 01:17:48,797
Yeah. Then go meet him one...

701
01:17:51,853 --> 01:17:54,111
I found God, he used to say.

702
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,759
Who has sitting and basking...

703
01:17:57,954 --> 01:18:00,129
in glory in subliminal mercy...

704
01:18:01,953 --> 01:18:04,088
I shot knee that son of a bitch...

705
01:18:18,148 --> 01:18:20,128
Yeah, you might wanna close your eyes kid.

706
01:27:05,312 --> 01:27:07,918
I'm injured.

707
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:10,095
What happened to you?

708
01:27:13,012 --> 01:27:16,430
A bear.

709
01:27:18,431 --> 01:27:19,704
A Grizzly.

710
01:27:38,314 --> 01:27:41,752
My men... left me for dead.

711
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:45,107
Killed my son.

712
01:27:48,712 --> 01:27:52,000
I lost my family too.

713
01:27:54,244 --> 01:27:56,312
Sioux killed my people.

714
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:06,203
I'm going south to find more Pawnee.

715
01:28:08,067 --> 01:28:09,770
My heart bleeds...

716
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:15,945
But revenge is in the creator's hands.

717
01:28:24,765 --> 01:28:25,957
You will ride with me...

718
01:29:34,062 --> 01:29:35,478
Your body is rotten.

719
01:29:36,881 --> 01:29:38,184
Need to heal.

720
01:29:43,914 --> 01:29:44,998
You could die.

721
01:30:00,052 --> 01:30:01,141
Yeah!

722
01:30:01,227 --> 01:30:02,913
There she is.

723
01:30:04,653 --> 01:30:05,847
We did it.

724
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:09,342
You ought to be proud of yourself boy.

725
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:11,361
Yeah.

726
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:14,735
Well we followed orders... We just kept
the funeral apart.

727
01:30:15,472 --> 01:30:18,581
Don't go down there starting going
no kind no conscience, alright?

728
01:30:19,056 --> 01:30:22,039
Cause sure is neither come will have
us both swinging from couple grants.

729
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:25,050
Now, we did what we had to do.

730
01:30:53,692 --> 01:30:56,406
We had the extra day, so we managed
to dig a little deeper...

731
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:58,712
leave some rocks on top, so that
the scavengers couldn't get out to him...

732
01:30:58,782 --> 01:31:00,559
we was done right and all.

733
01:31:01,646 --> 01:31:03,102
He was buried right.

734
01:31:03,793 --> 01:31:06,288
- Sir...
- The truth is that, ah...

735
01:31:07,773 --> 01:31:10,597
When Hawk disappeared,
I was worried about the savages.

736
01:31:11,027 --> 01:31:15,484
I was ready to get...
moving on out you know, but...

737
01:31:16,227 --> 01:31:18,570
Bridger here, he argued to stay.

738
01:31:19,567 --> 01:31:21,242
He argued to stay so that...

739
01:31:21,551 --> 01:31:24,252
He could at least build
the cross, or something...

740
01:31:24,991 --> 01:31:28,011
To put on top of Glass's grave,
and that's what he did...

741
01:31:28,948 --> 01:31:31,348
- That's what we did.
- Glad to hear you pulled your weight Mr. Bridger.

742
01:31:31,383 --> 01:31:32,356
I know you would.

743
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:36,376
Yeah, well, more than he pulled his weight
Captain is, this man here, he was my partner.

744
01:31:39,395 --> 01:31:40,480
Alright.

745
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,524
Am I to assume that there was agreed
arrangement did not changed?

746
01:31:46,632 --> 01:31:48,772
Fortunately for me it did not, no.

747
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,338
Thank you.

748
01:32:13,301 --> 01:32:15,241
For your courage, honor...

749
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,031
- And service.
- Yeah.

750
01:32:18,188 --> 01:32:21,671
Deal or no deal Mr. Bridger, you deserve
something for what you did.

751
01:32:22,512 --> 01:32:23,368
Thank you.

752
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:37,749
Kid's been beating himself up of
the bag hole trip.

753
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:45,425
We all saw the shape Glass was in,
it was no more to be done, right?

754
01:32:46,548 --> 01:32:47,474
Yeah.

755
01:32:49,172 --> 01:32:50,617
We all saw it.

756
01:32:59,429 --> 01:33:01,026
.

757
01:33:01,061 --> 01:33:01,605
.

758
01:33:01,906 --> 01:33:03,269
.

759
01:36:17,168 --> 01:36:21,040
When there is a storm...

760
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:29,121
And you stand in front of a tree...

761
01:36:30,589 --> 01:36:36,554
If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall...

762
01:36:42,499 --> 01:36:51,383
But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.

763
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:11,270
WE ARE ALL WILD

764
01:42:12,072 --> 01:42:14,431
There are traces of a camp...

765
01:42:15,289 --> 01:42:17,346
There are traces of a camp...

766
01:42:19,297 --> 01:42:20,163
Where?

767
01:42:20,387 --> 01:42:22,819
Entering the moon forest.

768
01:42:23,857 --> 01:42:28,236
Maybe two days ago.
They are moving east.

769
01:42:28,769 --> 01:42:30,741
Tell the others.

770
01:42:31,344 --> 01:42:34,533
Let's move quickly,
Powaqa could be with them!

771
01:42:55,675 --> 01:42:57,188
Bring me the girl...

772
01:42:58,435 --> 01:43:00,752
Those five horses
weren't for free.

773
01:44:25,033 --> 01:44:26,408
Don't make a sound.

774
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:31,962
Be quiet.

775
01:44:42,177 --> 01:44:48,448
I will get a horse.

776
01:44:49,037 --> 01:44:52,969
I'll cut off your balls.

777
01:45:07,789 --> 01:45:10,084
Where is Toussaint?

778
01:45:13,513 --> 01:45:14,953
Come here...

779
01:46:06,729 --> 01:46:08,764
- May I join you?
- Yes.

780
01:46:08,799 --> 01:46:10,013
- Yeah?
- Yes.

781
01:46:11,017 --> 01:46:14,195
Damn I was wondering when we might
be getting paid for that haul?

782
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:18,752
Cause them pelts we collect,
they are still out there...

783
01:46:19,429 --> 01:46:23,174
They're covered with dirt and some snow, but
they are there, and that ain't my fault.

784
01:46:24,021 --> 01:46:26,780
I'm waiting for Captain Leavenworth
to arrive with his army...

785
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:28,481
And then we'll have enough men...

786
01:46:28,545 --> 01:46:30,674
To get back out there
and shoot some civilization...

787
01:46:30,702 --> 01:46:34,322
into those fucking Arikara,
get back our pelts.

788
01:46:34,412 --> 01:46:36,124
Alright, alright.

789
01:46:37,101 --> 01:46:38,843
And now when is that supposed to happen?

790
01:46:39,666 --> 01:46:40,818
I don't know but...

791
01:46:41,251 --> 01:46:42,938
Until then nobody gets paid.

792
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:47,377
Listen here, alright?

793
01:46:48,265 --> 01:46:51,523
I was hired to trap them...
I wasn't hired to guard them.

794
01:46:52,227 --> 01:46:57,106
The way I see it... you got a safe.

795
01:46:57,266 --> 01:46:59,809
- Probably full of money.
- You signed a contract.

796
01:47:00,454 --> 01:47:03,069
To protect your boss and
your boss's property.

797
01:47:04,454 --> 01:47:07,404
And that safe isn't full anymore,
it's short about $300.

798
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:10,781
Short? Short? What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

799
01:47:11,483 --> 01:47:13,483
It means according to my cash records...

800
01:47:13,507 --> 01:47:17,020
You purchased more goods on the expedition
than what you are owed by the company.

801
01:47:22,629 --> 01:47:24,294
Happy New Year, Fitzgerald.

802
01:56:17,221 --> 01:56:19,384
FITZGERALD
KILLED MY SON

803
01:56:32,534 --> 01:56:33,739
White man at the gate.

804
01:56:41,169 --> 01:56:44,710
What's up? Who you are?

805
01:56:48,103 --> 01:56:50,488
I have no weapon, I have no weapons.

806
01:56:52,023 --> 01:56:54,303
- Dobb, get the Captain.
- I have no weapon.

807
01:56:54,363 --> 01:56:55,580
Where are your men?

808
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:57,863
- Dead, all dead.
- Who was he?

809
01:56:59,144 --> 01:57:01,749
I don't know, something to eat please.

810
01:57:01,828 --> 01:57:03,069
Food comes at price.

811
01:57:04,504 --> 01:57:07,277
- I have no money.
- Then you don't eat this, see how that works.

812
01:57:07,301 --> 01:57:10,248
Maybe you can give back some of them stolen
pelts you buy from the Indians.

813
01:57:10,372 --> 01:57:12,274
- Not now Jones.
- Silver.

814
01:57:12,309 --> 01:57:13,445
This is silver.

815
01:57:14,781 --> 01:57:16,069
Oh yeah?

816
01:57:17,077 --> 01:57:18,133
This all you got?

817
01:57:20,662 --> 01:57:25,337
We was 9... But my friend
he died in the snow...

818
01:57:25,701 --> 01:57:26,950
And the others were...

819
01:57:27,998 --> 01:57:31,032
By wolves... by wolves...

820
01:57:32,409 --> 01:57:33,945
Wait where did you get this?

821
01:57:34,863 --> 01:57:36,191
The canteen.

822
01:57:36,737 --> 01:57:38,707
He... he drop it in the snow.

823
01:57:39,232 --> 01:57:42,834
- Who, who?
- I do not know, I don't see. I don't see.

824
01:57:45,042 --> 01:57:46,119
It could be Hawk.

825
01:57:48,903 --> 01:57:52,099
- Yeah, it could be.

826
01:57:52,223 --> 01:57:53,843
- Maybe it was the Weston.
- How far from here?

827
01:57:54,090 --> 01:57:56,401
- How far from here?
- 13 miles...

828
01:57:56,542 --> 01:58:00,076
Northwest... Near the Yellowstone.

829
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:01,443
- Get the horses saddled.

830
01:58:02,064 --> 01:58:03,980
- Torches and supplies, $10 a men.

831
01:58:04,798 --> 01:58:07,337
- Anderson, you stay here.
- Yes sir.

832
01:58:07,489 --> 01:58:09,061
- Feed him and watch him...

833
01:58:10,751 --> 01:58:12,024
- I'll get you a drink.

834
01:58:24,614 --> 01:58:25,773
Open the gate.

835
01:59:03,572 --> 01:59:04,719
- Keep your guard up.

836
01:59:07,037 --> 01:59:08,133
- Eyes in front.

837
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:11,233
Nice and easy.

838
01:59:13,916 --> 01:59:15,356
Slow.

839
01:59:20,092 --> 01:59:21,221
Who you are?

840
01:59:21,752 --> 01:59:23,737
Beckett? Is that you?

841
01:59:23,738 --> 01:59:24,843
Weston?

842
01:59:35,324 --> 01:59:36,203
Glass.

843
01:59:37,141 --> 01:59:38,272
- That's Glass...
- Glass...

844
01:59:38,307 --> 01:59:39,220
It's okay.

845
01:59:39,532 --> 01:59:40,775
Jesus Christ.

846
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:42,583
Jesus Christ, what happened?

847
01:59:43,875 --> 01:59:45,096
Where is he?

848
01:59:48,363 --> 01:59:49,932
Johns take him, go.

849
01:59:50,488 --> 01:59:51,880
Go, I'm riding ahead.

850
01:59:51,974 --> 01:59:53,485
- Phil.
- Take Bridger.

851
01:59:54,732 --> 01:59:55,875
Take Bridger.

852
01:59:56,168 --> 01:59:57,683
- You got it Glass.
- Go.

853
02:00:04,330 --> 02:00:05,450
Open the gate.

854
02:00:10,644 --> 02:00:12,507
- Have you seen Fitzgerald?
- No sir.

855
02:00:18,797 --> 02:00:19,682
Get up.

856
02:00:20,364 --> 02:00:21,211
Get up.

857
02:00:21,251 --> 02:00:22,824
- Have you seen Fitzgerald?
- No sir.

858
02:00:22,859 --> 02:00:23,742
Fitzgerald.

859
02:00:35,002 --> 02:00:36,264
- Oh easy.
- Where did he go?

860
02:00:37,846 --> 02:00:39,046
- Who?
- Fitzgerald.

861
02:00:39,299 --> 02:00:40,260
Where did he go?

862
02:00:41,111 --> 02:00:43,554
- I have no idea.
- Tell me or I'll take your head off.

863
02:00:43,558 --> 02:00:46,370
- Captain, I swear to God.
- Tell me!

864
02:00:46,813 --> 02:00:48,303
- Tell me!
- Texas.

865
02:00:48,338 --> 02:00:50,675
- Texas?
- He said he was going to Texas.

866
02:00:51,331 --> 02:00:53,152
I swear to God, he said he was
going to re-enlist.

867
02:00:53,283 --> 02:00:56,341
And he start talking of a property,
a decent piece of land...

868
02:00:56,884 --> 02:00:59,267
He's heading to Texas. I swear to god.

869
02:00:59,287 --> 02:01:00,357
Stay here.

870
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:04,830
Fitzgerald.

871
02:01:06,511 --> 02:01:08,061
Fitzgerald.

872
02:01:36,944 --> 02:01:38,008
God dammit.

873
02:01:41,288 --> 02:01:42,471
God dammit.

874
02:01:47,133 --> 02:01:48,352
Open the gate.

875
02:01:48,837 --> 02:01:49,992
Open her up.

876
02:01:52,573 --> 02:01:53,881
Search Captain.

877
02:02:00,082 --> 02:02:02,392
Get him to the doctor, now.

878
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:05,298
You said he was dead.

879
02:02:06,258 --> 02:02:08,688
- You said he was dead.
- I thought he was dead, I swear.

880
02:02:11,028 --> 02:02:12,632
- You're a liar.
- He lied to me.

881
02:02:12,653 --> 02:02:15,956
Liar, you left. You left him out there.

882
02:02:16,089 --> 02:02:18,439
- I thought he was...
- Say the Lord's prayer.

883
02:02:18,477 --> 02:02:21,032
- What?
- Say the Lord's prayer.

884
02:02:22,324 --> 02:02:23,840
Our father...

885
02:02:23,948 --> 02:02:26,940
Who art in heaven... I can't...

886
02:02:27,041 --> 02:02:27,772
Shut up.

887
02:02:27,894 --> 02:02:31,300
Shut up! From here on you are a prisoner
charged with treason.

888
02:02:32,016 --> 02:02:34,678
Take him to the cage. Take him to the cage!

889
02:02:34,705 --> 02:02:36,196
You handle or I'll shoot him!

890
02:02:37,252 --> 02:02:38,819
I thought he was gonna die.

891
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:41,951
- Get up.
- Doc.

892
02:02:43,342 --> 02:02:44,938
I could help, please.

893
02:02:45,952 --> 02:02:48,387
- Please Captain...
- God!

894
02:02:49,592 --> 02:02:50,904
Alright. Come on.

895
02:02:59,744 --> 02:03:01,221
1, 2, 3.

896
02:03:01,256 --> 02:03:02,900
Slide, slide. Slide.

897
02:03:22,092 --> 02:03:24,389
- How is he?
- He'll be fine, but there is swelling...

898
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:25,569
needs to rest.

899
02:03:26,101 --> 02:03:27,418
I'll be back to check up on him.

900
02:03:37,315 --> 02:03:39,154
He ran off, didn't he?

901
02:03:48,037 --> 02:03:50,142
Bridger is telling the truth...

902
02:03:52,438 --> 02:03:56,159
- How is that?
- Fitzgerald lied to him...

903
02:03:56,343 --> 02:03:58,004
He was just following orders.

904
02:04:00,172 --> 02:04:03,646
He wasn't there when Fitzgerald stabbed
my boy to death.

905
02:04:07,839 --> 02:04:12,775
Is that what happened?
He killed Hawk?

906
02:04:17,496 --> 02:04:18,870
I need a horse and a gun.

907
02:04:18,905 --> 02:04:20,980
- No, you need to rest
and something to eat.

908
02:04:21,379 --> 02:04:23,296
- I'm going after him.
- No.

909
02:04:24,858 --> 02:04:29,752
- You'll never find him without me.
- If we wait till morning he'll have a day head start and he get away.

910
02:04:29,915 --> 02:04:31,312
No he won't.

911
02:04:32,682 --> 02:04:34,077
He's afraid.

912
02:04:35,690 --> 02:04:37,936
He knows how far I came for him.

913
02:04:39,374 --> 02:04:43,721
Same as that elk, when they get afraid
they run deep in to the woods...

914
02:04:44,807 --> 02:04:46,558
I got him trapped, he just...

915
02:04:47,323 --> 02:04:50,481
- He doesn't know it yet.
- How can you be so sure?

916
02:04:51,863 --> 02:04:53,993
Cause he got everything to lose.

917
02:04:56,375 --> 02:04:59,088
All I had was that boy...

918
02:05:00,216 --> 02:05:01,943
And he took him from me.

919
02:05:06,006 --> 02:05:07,872
I can't let you go back out there.

920
02:05:08,403 --> 02:05:11,573
- Not again.
- No.

921
02:05:13,321 --> 02:05:15,476
I ain't afraid to die anymore.

922
02:05:17,803 --> 02:05:19,342
I've done that already.

923
02:05:25,335 --> 02:05:26,885
I'm going with you.

924
02:06:42,682 --> 02:06:45,412
It's his horse, alright. Yeah.

925
02:06:47,325 --> 02:06:49,200
No way he could have ridden
through the night.

926
02:06:49,791 --> 02:06:51,159
How far ahead?

927
02:06:52,091 --> 02:06:55,658
- Half a day at the most.
- Could be Ree.

928
02:06:56,767 --> 02:06:58,228
If they aren't his, we lose him.

929
02:06:59,510 --> 02:07:02,713
He must get re-enlisted so he can
justify killing again.

930
02:07:03,714 --> 02:07:05,422
This tracks right here are his.

931
02:07:07,547 --> 02:07:08,654
Come on.

932
02:07:15,659 --> 02:07:17,888
I can't remember my wife's face.

933
02:07:18,997 --> 02:07:21,208
Last week she was still with me.

934
02:07:23,183 --> 02:07:24,543
Now she's gone.

935
02:07:27,943 --> 02:07:31,022
I worry I won't recognize her
when I get back home.

936
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:45,431
Is it true you killed an officer?

937
02:07:50,346 --> 02:07:53,520
I just killed a man who was
trying to kill my son.

938
02:08:12,449 --> 02:08:15,972
- Smoke.
- How close?

939
02:08:21,399 --> 02:08:23,285
No more than a mile up that way.

940
02:08:24,036 --> 02:08:26,984
I'm gonna head up to the west
you go down to the east...

941
02:08:27,412 --> 02:08:31,849
- See if we can find some tracks.
- What if it's the Ree?

942
02:08:32,944 --> 02:08:36,604
If it's the Ree, you turn right back around
and meet me back here.

943
02:10:02,063 --> 02:10:03,088
Hey!

944
02:10:05,284 --> 02:10:07,442
I wouldn't expect to find
a man of your stature...

945
02:10:08,381 --> 02:10:10,218
so far away from his stove when...

946
02:10:10,253 --> 02:10:12,539
the morning is so cold as this.
Captain, are you lost?

947
02:10:13,126 --> 02:10:15,268
I'm here to take you back to Fort Kahowa.

948
02:10:15,930 --> 02:10:17,740
Where you will be trialed for murder.

949
02:10:18,303 --> 02:10:19,520
Yes sir?

950
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:22,121
I ain't crazy about your plan.

951
02:10:22,725 --> 02:10:24,553
Besides, I got one of my own.

952
02:17:53,261 --> 02:17:55,303
We had a deal Glass.

953
02:17:59,178 --> 02:18:01,330
I tried to tell your boy, alright?

954
02:18:01,481 --> 02:18:04,510
I tried to tell him what was happening,
but he won't listen...

955
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:08,340
And he kept on screaming. And he was
gonna get everybody killed.

956
02:18:10,634 --> 02:18:11,727
You and me...

957
02:18:12,153 --> 02:18:13,374
we had a deal.

958
02:18:15,585 --> 02:18:17,242
We all know what happened out there.

959
02:18:18,362 --> 02:18:20,322
And on my soul to Lord.

960
02:18:20,429 --> 02:18:22,787
Lord he knows what happened out there.

961
02:18:26,082 --> 02:18:27,594
There was no deal.

962
02:18:30,818 --> 02:18:32,392
You killed my boy.

963
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:38,176
Maybe you should have raised a man...

964
02:18:38,377 --> 02:18:40,526
Instead of a some girlie little bitch.

965
02:18:51,987 --> 02:18:53,514
God dammit!

966
02:21:17,005 --> 02:21:20,159
You came all this way
just for your revenge?

967
02:21:23,726 --> 02:21:25,108
Well you enjoy it Glass.

968
02:21:26,383 --> 02:21:29,284
Cause there ain't nothing gonna bring
your boy back.

969
02:21:52,838 --> 02:22:00,285
Revenge is in God's hands...

970
02:22:00,529 --> 02:22:02,128
not mine.
