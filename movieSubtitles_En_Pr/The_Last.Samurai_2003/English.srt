and cannon, Western clothing.

1052
02:20:41,892 --> 02:20:43,518
But...

1053
02:20:46,897 --> 02:20:50,942
...we cannot forget who we are...

1054
02:20:52,402 --> 02:20:56,907
...or where we come from.

1055
02:21:09,294 --> 02:21:11,880
Ambassador Swanbeck...

1056
02:21:12,047 --> 02:21:14,883
...I have concluded that your treaty...

1057
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:19,888
...is not in the best interest
of my people.

1058
02:21:20,639 --> 02:21:24,267
-Sir, if I may-
-So sorry...

1059
02:21:24,643 --> 02:21:26,436
...but you may not.

1060
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:30,107
This is an outrage!

1061
02:21:36,113 --> 02:21:37,280
[IN JAPANESE]
Enlightened One...

1062
02:21:37,447 --> 02:21:39,116
-...we should discuss this—
-Omura...

1063
02:21:39,282 --> 02:21:41,535
...you have done quite enough.

1064
02:21:41,702 --> 02:21:44,287
Everything I have done,
I have done for my country.

1065
02:21:44,496 --> 02:21:47,416
Then you will not mind
when I seize your family's assets...

1066
02:21:47,708 --> 02:21:50,252
...and present them
as my gift to the people.

1067
02:21:50,460 --> 02:21:52,796
You disgrace me.

1068
02:21:53,005 --> 02:21:55,340
If your shame is too unbearable...

1069
02:22:04,433 --> 02:22:05,892
...I offer you this sword.

1070
02:22:36,673 --> 02:22:39,217
[IN ENGLISH]
Tell me how he died.

1071
02:22:46,975 --> 02:22:51,521
I will tell you how he lived.

1072
02:23:00,781 --> 02:23:05,202
GRAHAM: And so the days
of the Samurai had ended.

1073
02:23:05,368 --> 02:23:10,916
Nations, like men, it is sometimes said,
have their own destiny.

1074
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,586
As for the American captain...

1075
02:23:14,753 --> 02:23:17,089
...no one knows what became of him.

1076
02:23:17,255 --> 02:23:20,717
Some say that he died of his wounds...

1077
02:23:20,884 --> 02:23:24,846
...others, that he returned
to his own country.

1078
02:23:25,013 --> 02:23:26,640
But I like to think...

1079
02:23:26,807 --> 02:23:31,895
...he may have at last found
some small measure of peace...

1080
02:23:32,062 --> 02:23:34,064
...that we all seek...

1081
02:23:34,815 --> 02:23:37,984
...and few of us ever find.
